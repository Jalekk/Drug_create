Elsewhere, vitamin E's chemical profile as a fat-soluble antioxidant that is capable of neutralizing free radicals in the body continues to generate ongoing interest and study regarding how and whether or not the vitamin can help prevent or delay various chronic diseases associated with free radicals or other potential biological effects that vitamin E possesses like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, ocular conditions, immune illnesses, cancer, and more. None of these ongoing studies have yet to elucidate any formally significant evidence, however.  Similarly, more effective clinical trials are necessary to confirm what has only been accrued as preliminary data when it comes to studies proposing the demonstration of alpha-tocopherol succinate's capability to act as an anti-cancer therapy or as a regulator of inflammation.""]","['Of the eight separate variants of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol is the predominant form of vitamin E in human and animal tissues, and it has the highest bioavailability. This is because the liver preferentially resecretes only alpha-tocopherol by way of the hepatic alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP); the liver metabolizes and excretes all the other vitamin E variants, which is why blood and cellular concentrations of other forms of vitamin E other than alpha-tocopherol are ultimately lower.  Furthermore, the term alpha-tocopherol generally refers to a group of eight possible stereoisomers which is often called all-rac-tocopherol for being a racemic mixture of all eight stereoisomers. Of the eight stereoisomers, the RRR-alpha-tocopherol - or sometimes referred to as the d-alpha-tocopherol - stereoisomer is the naturally occurring form of alpha-tocopherol that is perhaps best recognized by the alpha-TTP and has been reported to demonstrate approximately twice the systemic availability of all-rac-tocopherol.  As a result, often times (but certainly not always) the discussion of vitamin E - at least within the context of using the vitamin for health-related indications - is generally in reference to the use of RRR- or d-alpha-tocopherol.  Subsequently, without further evidence to suggest otherwise, alpha-tocpherol succinate is generally believed to undergo a logical de-esterification in the gastrointestinal tract before being subsequently absorbed as free tocopherol.']","['Naturally occurring or synthetic substances that inhibit or retard oxidation reactions.

Among the tissues, only the skin of the Mymensingh specimens was found to be toxic in mouse test, with the toxicity scores of 31-923 ug/g. The toxin isolated from the skin was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance, and characterized as tetrodotoxin, a toxin principle.', 'Tetrodotoxin (TTX) and its analogs (TTXs), widely distributed among marine as well as terrestrial animals, induce dangerous intoxications. These highly potential toxins are also known as the causative agent of puffer fish poisoning. ... TTX, anhydrotetrodotoxin, 11-deoxytetrodotoxin and trideoxytetrodotoxin were determined in separated tissues of Bangladeshi marine puffers, Takifugu oblongus. TTX was predominant in skin, muscle and liver, whereas trideoxytetrodotoxin preponderated in the ovary. The toxicity of the various tissues was determined by a mouse bioassay.', 'To investigate the relationship between the toxicity of puffer fish and the distribution of tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria in puffer fish Fugu rubripes collected from the Bohai Sea of China, bacteria were isolated from each organ (ovaries, livers, intestines and gallbladders) and screened for tetrodotoxin (TTX) production. 20 out of 36 isolated strains were found to produce TTX in vitro. In the organs of ovaries and livers whose toxicity is more potent than other organs, the number and toxicity of TTX-producing strains was greater than that of others. Most TTX-producing bacterial strains were identified as Bacillus spp. (19 strains) and Actinomycete spp. (1 strain) based on the morphological observation, physiological and biochemical characteristics and G+C content of DNA. The purified toxin was identified to be TTX by high performance liquid chromatography assay, thin-layer chromatography assay and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis. Our results suggested that TTX-producing bacteria are closely related to the toxification of the puffer fish. More research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of TTX synthesis and the role of TTX in bacteria.', 'The liver homogenate of puffer fish was fractionated into blood cell, nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal and cytosol fractions by the differential centrifugation method. ... Analyses by HPLC and LC-FABMS demonstrated that tetrodotoxin is the major toxic principle in each fraction. These results reveal that tetrodotoxin is widely distributed in organelles in liver cells, though predominantly in the cytosol fraction.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for Tetrodotoxin (9 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['The metabolic source of tetrodotoxin is uncertain. No algal source has been identified, and until recently tetrodotoxin was assumed to be a metabolic product of the host. However, recent reports of the production of tetrodotoxin/anhydrotetrodotoxin by several bacterial species, including strains of the family Vibrionaceae, Pseudomonas sp., and Photobacterium phosphoreum, point toward a bacterial origin of this family of toxins.', 'To investigate the genes related to the biosynthesis or accumulation of tetrodotoxin (TTX) in pufferfish, mRNA expression patterns in the liver from pufferfish, akamefugu Takifugu chrysops and kusafugu Takifugu niphobles, were compared by mRNA arbitrarily primed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RAP RT-PCR) with fish bearing different concentrations of TTX and its derivatives. RAP RT-PCR provided a 383 bp cDNA fragment and its transcripts were higher in toxic than non-toxic pufferfish liver. Its deduced amino acid sequence was similar to those of fibrinogen-like proteins reported for other vertebrates. Northern blot analysis and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) revealed that the cDNA fragment of 383 bp was composed of at least three fibrinogen-like protein (flp) genes, flp-1, flp-2 and flp-3. Relative mRNA levels of flp-1, flp-2 and flp-3 showed a linear correlation with toxicity of the liver for two pufferfish species.']",

The radioactivity was quantitatively (199.8%) between 0-72 hr after dosing. Most of this was distributed equally between the urine and feces; 1.5% was found in the carcass skin and intestines. Structural analysis of the urinary metabolites showed that the metabolism proceeded via a complex multistep series of biotransformations involving nitro-group reduction side-chain oxidation and removal and the subsequent formation of a variety of heterocyclic ring structures. A major metabolite was 7-amino-2-ethyl-5-methylsulfonyl-1-propylbenzimidazole; this accounted for only 3-4% of the ingested radioactivity and was 1 of 5 metabolites produced in this yield. Seven other metabolites were identified none of which was derived from single-step biotransformation of nitralin.

The method for preparation of labelled ochratoxin B involves the synthesis of the azide of ochratoxin beta via the mixed anhydride and subsequent conjugation to labelled phenylalanine to yield (14)C-ochratoxin B. The labelled ochratoxins were injected into male Wistar rats and after different survival times they were sacrificed and subjected to whole body autoradiography. The distribution pattern of ochratoxin A in the rat did not differ from that earlier registered for mouse. The previously known, high susceptibility of rats (and not mice) to ochratoxin A-induced cancer could thus not be explained by an accumulation of the toxin in specific cells or organs. The distribution patterns of ochratoxin A and B were almost congruent--the only apparent difference being a much longer retention of the labelled ochratoxin A in the blood compared to ochratoxin B, which was much faster excreted. When analyzing tissue extracts for labelled metabolites only the extracts from the rats injected with ochratoxin B were found to contain easily detectable concentrations, while no metabolites of ochratoxin A were seen.', 'Mixture of ochratoxins A and B (0.38 and 0.13 mg/kg body wt) was fed to pigs daily for 8 days during early pregnancy.

It was isolated from the incubation mixture by extraction, thin-layer chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography, and crystallization. On the basis of mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the structure is suggested to be 4-hydroxyochratoxin B. The Km for the formation of 4-hydroxyochratoxin B was determined, and the hydroxylation of ochratoxin A was not altered by the presence of ochratoxin B. Rats were given ochratoxin A or B, or a mixture of both intraperitoneally. The ratios of the three metabolites, ochratoxin A, (4R)-4-hydroxyochratoxin A, and ochratoxin alpha, excreted in the urine did not change in the presence of ochratoxin B. Ochratoxin B was metabolized to 4-hydroxyochratoxin B and ochratoxin beta, but in a different ratio than for the ochratoxin A metabolites. When given intraperitoneally, ochratoxin beta was excreted within 24 hr. In rats treated with ochratoxin A alone, the food intake was reduced by 50%, and histologically severe lesions, degeneration, and necrosis were observed in the proximal tubules. When ochratoxin A and B given in combination, the animals were clinically unaffected and histologically there was only slight damage of proximal tubules. These observations indicate that ochratoxin B considerably reduces the toxic effects of ochratoxin A.', 'The objectives of this study were to develop and evaluate procedures for the confirmation of ochratoxin A (OA), lactone opened OA (OP-OA), ochratoxin B (OB), hydroxy OA (OA-OH) and ochratoxin alpha (Oalpha) and metabolites formed in the rats from these toxins, and to demonstrate that many ochratoxin metabolites can be identified in the bile and urine of rats injected with the different ochratoxins. An esterification procedure in acidified methanol and a lactone hydrolysis procedure in strong base yielded two additional forms of most of the different ochratoxins. The esterification procedure provided a simple, fast and reliable method for the confirmation of the ochratoxins. A total of 20 different metabolites of OA, OP-OA, OB, OA-OH and Oalpha were detected in the urine and the bile of rats of which several were identified. Among these, OA and the recently discovered and toxic form of OA (OP-OA) were readily formed in vivo when either were injected. Procedures developed in this study can be used to confirm and isolate ochratoxins in biological samples and have shown that a new form of OA (OP-OA) along with many other metabolites are formed from OA and related ochratoxins in vivo.']",

The concentration of ochratoxin A in the blood as a function of time was the same after oral administration of equivalent amounts of either ochratoxin C or ochratoxin A. The maximum ochratoxin A concentrations were measured 60 min after administration. Given intravenously, ochratoxin C was also converted to ochratoxin A. Maximum concentrations were reached after 90 min. It is concluded that ochratoxin C is readily converted to ochratoxin A after both oral and intravenous administration. There is reason to believe that a comparable toxicity of the two toxins is based upon this conversion and that only interference with the biotransformation mechanisms may cause a difference in their toxicity.', '...The metabolic profile of ochratoxin A (OA) /was studied/ in rats and in a culture of OA-producing Aspergillus ochraceus.

Green fluorescent biomacromolecules were isolated by detergent extraction of the fungal culture followed by cold-acetone precipitation and gel filtration. Acid hydrolysis of the fluorescent macromolecules resulted in the release of several ochratoxins, including O alpha (80%), OA (2%), and OC (5%), and other unidentified fluorescent compounds but not OB and O beta. Cross-reactivity studies of the natural macromolecule conjugates of OA with anti-OA polyclonal antibodies indicated that they were covalently linked to the macromolecules via a group other than the carboxyl group. These studies demonstrated that a fungus can produce some of the same metabolites of OA as the rat and that O alpha, OA, and OC may be covalently linked to fungal macromolecules.']",

Circulating concentrations of chlorophenols were determined in Wistar rats and Swiss mice given a single 200 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection of hexachlorocyclohexane.

No qualitative species difference was detected in chromatographic profiles of chlorophenols extracted from mouse and rat liver after continuous 2 month administration of hexachlorocyclohexane. Only 2,6-dichlorophenol was significantly higher in mouse live than that observed in rat liver: 1292.5 ng/g in mouse and 140.0 ng/g in rat. No qualitative difference was observed in the chlorophenols of blood of mice and rats. However, the concentration of 2,6-dichlorophenol was 11.52 ug/ml compared to 1.65 ug/ml in mouse blood. In vitro, 647 picomoles/mg/hour 2,4,6-trichlorophenol were formed by rat liver microsomes, compared to 219 picomoles/mg/hour by mouse liver microsomes. It was concluded that hexachlorocyclohexane may be a tumor promoting agent which acts by facilitating the development of latent initiated cells of unknown origin. Differential plasma clearance of 2,6-dichlorophenol may account for species differences in its concentration; however it is unlikely that it plays a major role in the induction of liver tumors in mice.', 'The metabolism of tetrachlorobenzenes was investigated in the squirrel monkey and a comparison made of the interspecies metabolism of such compounds. Three groups of four male monkeys were given orally single doses of one of three tetrachlorobenzene isomers in corn oil twice per week for 3 weeks. The dose levels for 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene were 100 mg/kg, and the dose level for 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene was 50 mg/kg. Respective levels of fecal excretion at 48 hours were 38, 36, and 18% of the initial doses. No metabolism occurred for 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene in the squirrel monkey.

For animals dosed with either 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene or 1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene, the fecal radioactivity demonstrated elimination of at least 50% unchanged compound.

The rate of elimination of the biliary metabolites, although high, does not reach a rapid peak followed by a rapid decline, but suggests prolonged elimination of the metabolites from the body into the bile. ...', 'When Tropital was fed to mice, rats or hamsters, degradation occurred primarily at the side chain with excretion of metobolites in the urine. Some metabolism of the methylene dioxide to carbon dioxide also occurred. The glycine and glucuronate conjugates were found. Rats, mice and rabbits, admin Tropital orally, metabolized the Tropital to piperonal, piperonylic acid, N-piperonyglycine and two unidentified acid cmpd. When piperonylic acid was fed to mice, both the free acid and glycine conjugate were observed. After incubation of tropital with mouse liver microsomes and NADPH2, Tropital was degraded to piperonylic acid via piperonal.', 'The metabolism of methylenedioxyphenyl (MDP) compounds was studied in mammals. The purpose of the study was to investigate the mechanism and significance of demethylation of MDP and similar compounds in relation to the metabolism and mode of action of commercial synergist chemicals such as piperonyl-butoxide and tropital. Male Swiss-Webster-mice, Sprague-Dawley-rats, or hamsters were administered 13 carbon-14 labeled MDP compounds such as tropital, piperonal, piperonyl-alcohol, piperonylic-acid, safrole, dihydrosafrole, or piperonyl-butoxide. Urine, feces, and expired air were collected for 48 hours for carbon-14 assay. Carbon-14 activity in the intestine, liver, and carcass was determined. Urine samples were analyzed for metabolites. Compounds such as dihydrosafrole, safrole, myristicin, and piperonyl-butoxide were largely metabolized by oxidation of the methylene group of the MDP moiety to yield radiolabeled carbon-dioxide. The radiolabel ultimately appearing as carbon-dioxide was first liberated as radioactive formate. Carbon-dioxide was not an important route of elimination in the metabolism of piperonyl-alcohol, piperonal, piperonylic-acid, and tropital. Their metabolites were excreted primarily in the urine. No marked species difference was noted in carbon-14 tissue distribution after dosing with tropital and piperonyl-butoxide. Oxidation or conjugation of the side chain was the major metabolic pathway for tropital, piperonal, piperonyl-alcohol, and piperonylic-acid. Urinary metabolites of piperonyl-butoxide included many compounds lacking the MDP moiety and small amounts of 6-propyl-piperonylic-acid and its glycine conjugate. Urinary metabolites of tropital included glycine and glucuronic-acid conjugates of piperonylic-acid. In an in-vitro experiment, radiolabeled piperonyl-butoxide, tropital, safrole, and other MDP compounds were incubated with mouse liver microsomes and were assayed for metabolites. Metabolites such as formate and catechols were detected. The authors conclude that demethylation of the MDP moiety is the major metabolic pathway in mammals given piperonyl-butoxide, safrole, dihydrosafrole and myristicin.']",

In order to test this hypothesis, several agents that enhance or reduce production of the DBF metabolite putatively involved in cross-linking were tested. Increasing NADPH concentrations in the medium enhanced cross-link production; 1,2-epoxy-3,3,3-trichloropropane (TCPO), an inhibitor of epoxide hydrolases, slightly reduced DNA-protein cross-link formation at high concentrations; norharman (NH), an inhibitor of certain steps in the metabolism of DBF, totally blocked cross-linking. The possible involvement of DBF-bisdihydrodiol, a bifunctional metabolite identified in vitro, is discussed. Postincubation in DBF-free medium did not induce a significant reduction in cross-links, indicating that repair did not take place.', 'Dibenzo[a,e]fluoranthene, its 7-hydroxy, 3,4- and 12,13-dihydrodiol metabolic derivatives as well as three synthetic, structurally related hydrocarbons, were tested for mutagenicity towards Salmonella typhimurium TA100 strain in the presence of 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rat and mouse liver post-mitochondrial supernatants. Of these compounds, the 12,13-dihydrodiol showed the highest activity, being 6-10 times more mutagenic than the parent compound. Our data, in conjunction with those of previous studies on the liver microsomal metabolism and DNA binding of dibenzo[a,e]fluoranthene and its dihydrodiols, indicate that activation of dibenzo[a,e]fluoranthene to bacterial mutagens may occur predominantly through a vicinal, non-bay-region 12,13-dihydrodiol epoxide.', 'When dibenzo[a,e]fluoranthene (DBF) is incubated in vitro with mouse liver microsomes in the presence of calf thymus DNA, several metabolites bind covalently to DNA. The metabolite-nucleoside adducts were separated by h.p.l.c. after enzymatic hydrolysis. The elution profile of this chromatogram exhibits six main peaks, labeled from A to F in order of decreasing polarity. It was compared to those obtained by direct reaction of DNA with 3,4-dihydroxy-1,2-epoxy 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro DBF (the bay region diol-epoxide) or 12,13-dihydroxy 10,11-epoxy 10,11,12,13-tetrahydro DBF (the pseudo bay region diol-epoxide). In both cases the retention period of the peak of the adduct was identical to that of the main peak E. The fluorescence spectra of these two adducts were similar to those of the corresponding tetrols. When DNA is reacted in the presence of microsomes with 3,4-dihydrodihydroxy DBF, the elution profile of the adducts indicates that vicinal epoxidation of the dihydrodiol and direct reaction is dominant. The metabolic reaction with 12,13-dihydrodihydroxy DBF appears more complex as revealed by the observed number of adducts which correspond to vicinal epoxidation of dihydrodiol as well as further oxidation at other sites.', 'The effects of norharman (NH) (a putative vicinal diolepoxidation inhibitor in DBF metabolism) on the metabolism of dibenzo[a,e]-fluoranthene (DBF) and on its fixation on DNA, RNA and proteins have been studied in vitro by incubation with S-9 and microsomes from rats and mice. Norharman (a putative vicinal diolepoxidation inhibitor in DBF metabolism) causes a decrease of the activity of microsome monooxygenases proportionally to its concentration but has no effect on the activity of NADPH p450 reductase nor on that of epoxide hydrolase. Paradoxically, the amount of DBF hydrophobic metabolites and especially that of diols and phenols, increases in the incubation mixture in the presence of NH; this increase is independent of the presence of conjugation enzymes of cytosol. Norharman (a putative vicinal diolepoxidation inhibitor in DBF metabolism) does not modify the covalent binding of DBF on the microsome RNA, conversely it decreases the binding of DBF on the DNA and on the proteins of the incubation mixture. This could partly explain the increase of DBF diols and phenols by an accumulative effect. Two higher homologs of NH: benzo[g]-beta carboline and benzo[i]-beta carboline, tested under the same conditions, proved inhibitory.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for Dibenzo(a,e)fluoranthene (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']",

The authors reported that this effect appeared within 12 hr in rats fed a diet containing 1% 4-(para-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone for-7 days, and disappeared within 9 hr when the rats were returned to normal diet. The ketonuria, which was possibly due to metabolites present in the urine, was considered not to be a toxic effect.', '1. The metabolism of 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)butan-2-one(raspberry ketone) was studied in rats, guinea-pigs and rabbits. 2. Following intragastric dosage (1 mmol/kg) urinary metabolite excretion was nearly complete within 24 hr, amounting to roughly 90% of the dose in all species. 3. The most prominent urinary metabolites were raspberry ketone and its corresponding carbinol, both largely conjugated with glucuronic acid and/or sulphate. The extent of ketone reduction was greatest in rabbits. 4. Oxidative metabolism included ring hydroxylation and side-chain oxidation. The latter pathway led to 1,2- and 2,3-diol derivatives. It is proposed that the latter undergo cleavage to furnish the C6-C3 and C6-C2 derivatives detected.', 'A ketone (probably acetone) was found in the urine of rats fed p-hydroxyphenylbutanone at 1% in the diet. After administration of a single 200-mg dose, rats excreted about 6% of the dose unchanged within 24 hr. A positive reaction for ketones being obtained only in urine produced between 1 and 6 hr after treatment.']",

Rats exposed to 1-nitropyrene on particles excreted the majority of the deposited radioactivity in the feces (75 + or -18%), whereas animals exposed to 1-nitropyrene aerosol excreted a major portion of the radiolabel in the urine (76 + or - 18%). There was no difference in the rates of lung clearance of 1-nitropyrene between the two groups. Most of the aerosol was cleared from the respiratory tract by direct absorption into the blood, while particle associated nitropyrene was cleared by both blood absorption & mucociliary clearance followed by ingestion & fecal excretion.', 'Male Fischer 344 rats were exposed by nose only inhalation to various concns of [14C]1-nitropyrene & [14C]1-nitropyrene coated on diesel exhaust particles (50-1100 ug/cu m 1-nitropyrene; particulate concn, 70-7200 ug/cu m). Over the range of concns tested, the pathways for excretion of [14C]1-nitropyrene in urine & feces were independent of the concn of nitropyrene, whether given alone or associated with diesel exhaust particles. In all cases, fecal excretion was the major route of elimination, about twice as much being excreted by this route as in the urine. The fractional deposition of [14C]1-nitropyrene in the respiratory tract did not appear to be dependent on the concn. Half times for elimination of (14)C in urine & feces were about 15-20 hr. Lungs of rats exposed to [14C]1-nitropyrene coated on diesel exhaust particles contained nearly 5 times more (14)C than lungs from rats exposed to (14C)-1-nitropyrene alone within 1 hr after exposure. This difference was increased to 80 fold at 94 hr after exposure. The long term half time for clearance of (14)C in the lungs of rats exposed to coated diesel particles was 36 days, in contrast to two days after exposure to 1-nitropyrene alone. The GI absorption of the same 1-nitropyrene preparations was studied after an oral dose of 10 ug/kg bw. Within 1 hr, >90% of (14)C was found in nitropyrene metabolites. The overall excretion pattern of 14C was similar after intratracheal instillation of male Sprague Dawley rats with [14C]1-nitropyrene (8 nmol [2 ug]) either coated onto diesel particles (dose, 20 mg/kg bw), instilled along with unlabelled diesel particles, or administered alone, & was also similar to that seen after ip injection of (14)C-1-nitropyrene alone.

In isolated perfused rat livers, N-acetyl-l-aminopyrene was the major metabolite of (14)C 1-nitropyrene; smaller quantities of 1-aminopyrene & hydroxy-l-nitropyrenes were detected.', 'Chinese hamster ovary cells, Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, calf thymus cells, rabbit alveolar macrophages, rabbit epithelial cells & human diploid fibroblasts catalysed the reduction of 1-nitropyrene to an intermediate which bound to DNA, giving an adduct identified as N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-l-aminopyrene. Incubation of rabbit lung & tracheal tissues with [14C]1-nitropyrene resulted in association of the radioactivity with cellular DNA. Primary rat hepatocytes, Chinese hamster V79 cells & human hepatoma HepG2 cells catalysed the conversion of 1-nitropyrene into 1-aminopyrene. Oxidized metabolites were also detected with the latter cell line. Cytosolic preparations from the livers of rats, rabbits, & dogs catalysed the reduction of 1-nitropyrene to 1-aminopyrene. Postmitochondrial supernatants of rat liver, lung & nasal tissue & of rabbit & hamster lung & liver catalysed both the oxidation & reduction of 1-nitropyrene. Guinea-pig liver microsomes also catalysed the oxidation of 1-nitropyrene. In some instances, this metab was accompanied by binding to exogenous DNA.

Inflammation is a primary defense mechanism and the homeostatic response of the immune system; however, a prolonged inflammatory response in certain disorders may lead to tissue damage, pain, and swelling. Beclomethasone dipropionate works by attenuating the inflammatory responses associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, and corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. It suppresses the actions of inflammatory cells, such as mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. It also inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines. Beclomethasone dipropionate is reported to exhibit potent topical activity while possessing low systemic effects.   Beclomethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid drug with anti-inflammatory and vasoconstrictive effects used to treat chronic inflammatory processes such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. When inhaled, it improves lung function, decreases airway hyper-reactivity, and reduces the severity of asthmatic symptoms. Although inhaled corticosteroids, including beclomethasone dipropionate, are reported to mainly act locally in the lungs, systemic effects such as disruption of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, bone turnover, osteoporosis, and growth suppression may still be observed with chronic use or high dose administration. There were varying findings from clinical studies examining the effect of beclomethasone dipropionate on growth suppression in pediatric patients. It was shown to suppress the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in a dose-dependent manner. HPA axis is a central hormonal response system to stress and activation of HPA axis leads to the production of endogenous steroid hormone production. Long-term use of high-dose systemic corticosteroids, including those inhaled, was often associated with signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to stress conditions, such as trauma, surgery, or infections. As corticosteroids work by suppressing the immune system, there may be an increased risk for developing infections.

Single (10 uL) 28 hr applications of (14)C-labelled test material (undiluted or 1% aqueous dilution) were made to the epidermal surface of skin discs held in occluded flow diffusion cells at 31 °C. Receptor fluid (tissue culture medium containing 6% polyethylene glycol 20 oleyl ether) was collected at 2 h intervals. The solubility of chlorpyrifosmethyl in the receptor fluid was confirmed to be higher than the applied dose. For the concentrate, total recovery of radioactivity was high (92.27-99.32%). A lag time for penetration of 4-6 hr was observed; this was followed by linear absorption over the following 24 hr. For the spray strength dilution, total recovery of radioactivity was also high (95.05-100.89%). Distribution of radioactivity was consistent for all of the six replicates. A lag time for penetration of 8-10 hr was observed; this was followed by linear absorption over the remainder of the study. The linear absorption rate was calculated to be 10.4 ug/sq cm per hour for the concentrate and 0.039 ug/sq cm per hour for the 1% dilution. Dermal penetration was low for both formulation types.', 'Two male Sprague-Dawley rats (approximately 200 g) were gavaged with (14)C-radiolabelled chlorpyrifos-methyl (purity >99%; 377 MBq/mmol; labelled at positions 2 and 6 on the pyridyl ring) at a dose level of 16 mg/kg bw (in corn oil). Urine, feces and expired carbon dioxide were collected for up to 72 hr. Blood samples were taken from the tail at intervals throughout the study period. Radioactivity levels were determined by liquid scintillation counting or combustion analysis (fecal samples). Urinary metabolites were identified by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and autoradiography. Peak blood radioactivity levels were reported at 5 hr, at which point the amount of test material in the blood was calculated to be approximately 3.0% (2.4-3.7%; absolute levels not given) of the administered dose. Levels of radioactivity indicated rapid clearance from blood, and the peak level seen at 5 hr had declined by 50% at approximately 9 hr following administration, suggesting an initial half-life of approximately 4 hr. Excretion of radioactivity was found to be primarily in the urine and largely within 24 hr of administration. Radioactivity levels in expired air were minimal. Residual tissue radioactivity levels at 72 hr were low in all tissues (<1 part per million [ppm]), but varied markedly between the two animals.', 'When (14)C-bound residues were fed to male rats for 24 hours, the animals eliminated 75% of the radioactivity in urine, 7% in expired air and 8% in faeces after 3 days, indicating that the bound residues were highly bioavailable. A further ""bioavailable"" amount (4%) was found in selected organs.', 'Tissue distributions of dichlorvos, an organophosphate, and chlorpyrifos-methyl, an organophosphorothioate, were determined. Tiny amounts of dichlorvos, 0.067 and 0.027 mg/L, were detected in the vitreous humor and cerebrospinal fluid, respectively. Although dichlorvos (0.082-8.99 mg/L or mg/kg) was detected in the thoracic aortic blood, thoracic inferior vena caval blood, pericardial fluid, bile, and spleen, it was strongly suggested that it had diffused postmortem from the stomach, which contained 879 mg, because no dichlorvos was detected in the other blood samples and tissues tested. Substantial amounts (0.615-4.15 mg/L) of chlorpyrifos-methyl were detected in all blood samples, and the order of its concentrations was as follows: pulmonary vessel blood > thoracic inferior vena caval blood > blood in the right cardiac chambers > blood in the left cardiac chambers = thoracic aortic blood > right femoral venous blood. The total amount of chlorpyrifos-methyl in the stomach was 612 mg. However, it was strongly suggested that virtually no chlorpyrifos-methyl diffused from the stomach into surrounding fluids and tissues postmortem because no chlorpyrifos-methyl was detected in the bile and little was found in the pericardial fluids. Neither compound was detected in the urine. In vitro experiments showed that dichlorvos (10 mg/L) almost disappeared from fresh (pH 7.4) and acidified (pH 6.2) blood samples within 24 and 72 hr, respectively. However, 53 and 77% of the original amount of dichlorvos in 0.05M phosphate buffers at pH 7.4 and 6.2 were detected 72 hr later. Chlorpyrifos-methyl (1 mg/L) was very stable in blood samples, regardless of the pH, during the 72-hr study period, but in the pH 7.4 and 6.2 phosphate buffers, approximately 80% of the original amount had degraded after 72 hr. ... When sodium fluoride was added to blood samples, dichlorvos degraded completely within 15 min, and chlorpyrifos-methyl became very unstable. When analyzing samples to detect organophosphorus chemicals, this common preservative should not be added to fluid specimens.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for CHLORPYRIFOS-METHYL (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['Thyroid hormones are vital to a host of human physiological functions in both children and adults. Exposures to chemicals, including chlorpyrifos, have been found to modify thyroid signaling at environmentally relevant levels in animal studies. The aim of this study was to examine circulating T4 and TSH levels in relation to urinary concentrations of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPY), a metabolite of the organophosphorus insecticides chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-methyl, using data from individuals 12 years and older from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). NHANES datasets from 1999 to 2000 and 2001-2002 were combined, and individuals with thyroid disease, those taking thyroid medications, and pregnant women were excluded (N = 3249). Multivariable linear regression models for relationships between log-transformed urinary TCPY and serum total T(4) or log (TSH) were constructed adjusting for important covariates. Models were stratified by sex and a categorical age variable (12-18, 18-40, 40-60, and >60 years). In male participants, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in urinary TCPY was associated with statistically significant increases in serum T(4) of 3.8% (95th CI 0.75 to 7.0) among those 12-18 years of age and 3.5% (95th CI 0.13 to 7.0) in the 18-40 year age group, relative to median T4 levels using unweighted models. An IQR increase in TCPY was also associated with decreases in TSH of 10.7% (-18.7-2.05) among men 18-40 years old and 20.0% (95th CI -28.9 to -9.86) among men >60 years old. Conversely, urinary TCPY was positively associated with TSH in females >60 years of age. /3,5,6-Trichloro-2-pyridinol (chlorpyrifos-methyl metabolite)/', 'The urinary metabolites of chlorpyrifos-methyl were investigated by TLC ... . The primary metabolite was identified by co-chromatography as 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP). Additional non-mobile material was stated to be conjugated TCP. Metabolites were not quantified, and fecal metabolites were not investigated.', 'The oxidative desulfuration of the three phosphorothionate insecticides -- chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-methyl, and leptophos--was studied in rat brain and liver. Hepatic microsomes demonstrated activities of 4-28 nmol/g/min, with male activity 2- to 4-fold higher than female activity. Very low desulfuration activity of all three compounds was observed in both microsomal and crude mitochondrial fractions from brain (3-27 pmol/g/min). There were no sex differences in the brain. Although the liver displayed 140- to 2100-fold greater activity than brain on a wet-weight basis, the brain desulfuration activities of these three compounds as well as those of some previously reported phosphorothionates generally correlate well with the toxicity and may be important in determining the overall acute toxicity levels of phosphorothionate insecticides.', 'Urinary metabolites ... were identified by gas-liquid chromatography, TLC and mass spectrometry as 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) (13.8%), its glucuronide conjugate (68.6%) and the desmethyl metabolite O-methyl-O-(3,5,6-trichloropyridyl) phosphorothioate (17.8%). Feces were not analysed, as they contained less than 5% of the administered radiolabel.', 'A normal metabolic reaction with phosphorothioates is oxidative desulfuration or isomerization to give the oxon form, which is the more potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase.

Urinary excretion accounted for 5.2 and 33.2% of the total dose in the urine of the males at low and high dose levels, the corresponding figures for the female being 3.2 and 33.7%. In the feces, 6.4 and 3.4% were detected in the male, at low and high doses respectively, and 16.9 and 7.3% in the female. No residues were detected in blood, brain, fat, liver, kidney or muscle at sacrifice. The method of analysis employed would not detect dichlorobenzilic acid conjugates. The presence of the probable metabolite, dichlorobenzilic acid has been demonstrated in dog urine, by thin layer chromatography.', 'When (14)carbon-labelled chloropropylate was administered orally to pairs of male and female rats at about 1.6 mg/kg the radioactivity was excreted in the urine and feces. No radioactive carbon dioxide was expired. The excretion pattern of the radioactivity differed between the two sexes, the male voiding 75% of the dose in the feces, and 6% in the urine, and the female 49% in the feces and 31% in the urine. Most of the radioactivity was eliminated in the first 48 hours. The total tissue residue of radioactivity 120 hours after administration was 0.9% and 1.0% in the male and female respectively.

CB, CP, and BP were degraded by the rat liver preparations; however, CB was metabolized appreciably more than the other two acaricides. The maximum activity with CB was associated with the nuclear supernatant and the microsomal fractions. The major degradation products were 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone (DBP) and p-chlorobenzoic-acid (CBA). For CP, the nuclear and mitochondrial fractions were the most active.

Terbuthylazine was rapidly (50% excreted by 16-17 hrs) and completely metabolized and did not accumulate in tissues. Radioactivity was excreted equally in urine and feces in males, but in females about 66% of the radiolabel was excreted in the urine.', 'In mammals, following oral administration, 72-84% is eliminated in the urine and feces within 24 hr, and almost all within 48 hr.', 'Terbuthylazine (TBA) is an herbicide widely used in corn cultivation. Herein we evaluate the measurement of hair TBA as biomarkers of exposure. Five Sprague Dawley rats were gavaged with TBA for 3 days, and then the back hair was shaved and analyzed for TBA. In addition, head hair samples from 10 corn farmers, 9 rural residents, and 6 urban residents were collected at the end of the application season. Hair TBA was detected by liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry after solvent extraction. TBA was quantifiable in all rat samples with a mean concentration of 0.92 (+ or - 0.26)ng/mg, which corresponds to a 0.12% incorporation rate. TBA was quantifiable in all farmer samples (median: 0.67 ng/mg), in 75% of rural resident samples (0.01ng/mg) and in none of the urban resident samples (<0.01 ng/mg), with a statistical difference among groups (P<0.01). Our results suggest that TBA is incorporated in hair and prompt further investigation on the use of hair TBA as a potential biomarker of cumulative exposure.']","['Metabolism of terbuthylazine in rats is similar to other chloro-s-triazine herbicides. The major routes of metabolism are hydrolysis of the chlorine moiety and mono- or didealkylation. Hydroxylation of one or both of the dealkylated amine groups may also occur.', 'Urine and feces contained up to 25 and 15 identified metabolites, respectively, most of which were polar. Degradation of the triazine ring did not occur. Ammeline and ammelide, 2 dechlorinated and dealkylated/hydroxylated metabolites common to all triazines, were identified in low amounts in the feces.', 'In mammals, following oral administration, ...a de-ethyl metabolite forms rapidly, followed by conjugates of products formed by oxidation of one methyl group of the tert-butyl moiety. All are rapidly excreted.', '/Terbutylethylazine/ was rapidly metabolized to water soluble compounds in the leaves of corn, sorghum, and sugar cane and more slowly in susceptible barley, by displacement of the 2-chloro group with glutathione or gamma-glutamylcysteine.', 'The metabolism of atrazine (and three other triazine herbicides, terbuthylazine, ametryne, and tebutryne) has been investigated in vitro in liver microsomes from rats, pigs, and humans. The principal phase-1 reactions in all three species were N-monodealkylation, hydroxylation of the isopropyl or tert-butyl moiety and sulfoxidation of the substrate. Although all species produced the same type of metabolites, there were spiecies specific differences in the metabolite ratios. Subsequent studies have shown that cytochrome P450 1A2 is the major phase-1 enzyme involved in the metabolism of s-triazine in human liver micrsomes. /Triazine herbicides/', 'Terbuthylazine has known human metabolites that include 1-[[4-(tert-butylamino)-6-chloro-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl]amino]ethanol and 2-[[4-Chloro-6-(ethylamino)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl]amino]-2-methylpropan-1-ol.']",

The concentration ranges were 0.003 -0.301 mg/L for DEDIA, 0.005 -0.011 mg/L for DEA, 0.006 -0.276 mg/L for DIA, and 0.005 -0.012 mg/L for ATZ.', '...

Atrazine was metabolized via N-dealkylation with preferential formation of deisopropylatrazine over deethylatrazine. Two of the species were able to carry out the following incubation in glucose-supplemented mineral salts medium.', 'Deethylatrazine is primarily a mammalian metabolite but can be produced in plants and bacteria. Dealkylation of the ethyl group from the 4 position of the triazine ring yields deethylatrazine.', 'Manganese enhanced atrazine transformation by the fungus Pleurotus pulmonarius when added to a liquid culture medium at concentration of up to 300 uM. Both N-dealkylated and propylhydroxylated metabolites accumulated in the culture medium, with the former accumulating to a greater extent than did the latter. Lipid peroxidation, oxygenase and peroxidase activities, and the cytochrome P-450 concentration increased. In addition, an increase in the spectral interactions between atrazine and components in the cell extract was observed. Antioxidants, mainly nordihydroguaiaretic acid, which inhibits lipoxygenase, peroxidase, and P-450 activities, and piperonyl butoxide, which inhibits P-450 activity, inhibited atrazine transformation by the mycelium. It is suggested that the stimulation of oxidative activity by manganese might be responsible for increasing the biotransformation of atrazine and for nonspecific transformations of other xenobiotic compounds.']",

About 40 mg of the compound were absorbed from 50 mL of a lauryl sulfate-based gel containing 1.4 g 2,5-diaminotoluene within 3 hr. When 6% hydrogen peroxide was added to the gel immediately before use, the amount of 2,5-diaminotoluene sulfate absorbed was less than 3 mg', ""Ten milligrams of 2,5-diaminotoluene sulfate (equivalent to 5.54 mg 2,5- diamino-toluene) injected subcutaneously into six adult volunteers were excreted in the urine as the N,N'-diacetyl derivative, which accounted for approximately half of the injected dose, over 48 hr. During the process of hair dyeing with a dye formulation in which a total of 2.5 g 2,5-diaminotoluene sulfate were applied in conjunction with 6% hydrogen peroxide added just before application, it was estimated that 4.6 mg 2,5-diaminotoluene sulfate had been absorbed through the skin of five volunteers."", 'The absorption and elimination of toluene-2,5-diamine were studied in 5 male human subjects. A test formulation was prepared with [Me-(14)C]-toluene-2,5-diamine plus unlabeled toluene-2,5-diamine sulfate in a hair dye cream formulation containing 0.825% resorcinol. The final concentration of toluene-2,5-diamine sulfate was 1.65%. This formulation was then mixed with either 100 g of water (1:1) or 100 g of 6% hydrogen peroxide to produce formulation 1 and formulation 2, respectively. The subjects received 1 of the 2 formulations (45 g, containing a total of 371 mg of toluene-2,5-diamine) on a 250-sq cm area of the scalp. The formulation was thoroughly rinsed off after 30 minutes and the hair was shampooed. The mean total elimination rate of radioactivity of the applied dose in the urine and the feces was 4.81% +/-0.62% for formulation 1 and 1.31% +/- 0.14% in formulation 2. The amounts of toluene-2,5-diamine sulfate were 71 +/- 9.26 mgeq/ sq cm for formulation 1 and 20 +/- 2.02 mgeq/sq cm for formulation 2. The area under the curve (AUC) for whole blood recovery was 41.6 +/- 1.7 ngeq.hr/L and 9.2 +/- 3.1 ngeq.hr/L for formulations 1 and 2, respectively. The total recovery for formulation 1 was 91.2% +/- 1.73%, whereas the total recovery for formulation 2 was 47.64% +/- 3.43%. The authors concluded that the lower recovery for formulation 2 was due to higher retention of radiolabel in the hair as a result of the oxidative hair coloring process.', 'Percutaneous absorption of toluene-2,5-diamine sulfate in human skin samples was studied... Radiolabeled (97.2% pure) and non-radiolabeled (99.7% pure) toluene-2,5-diamine sulfate was added to a final concentration of 9% to 2 hair dye bases, one of which contained an equimolar amount of m-aminophenol as a coupler. The formulation containing the coupler was mixed with hydrogen peroxide (50:50) to yield a test substance with a final toluene-2,5-diamine sulfate concentration of 4.5%. The formulation base without the coupler was mixed with water or hydrogen peroxide, in both cases 50:50, to yield 2 other test substances with final concentrations of toluene-2,5-diamine sulfate of 4.5%. The formulations were then applied over an area of 2-sq cm to 350-mm-thick human skin (20 mg/sq cm) or samples of isolated epidermis mounted in perfusion cells. After an application period of 30 minutes, the test substance was rinsed off with water and a solution of sodium lauryl sulfate. Most of the test substance (93.5% of the applied dose) was recovered during rinsing at 30 minutes post application. Cumulative penetration (based on radioactivity in the receptor fluid) neared a plateau at approximately 5 hours. The total absorption in the formulation without coupler mixed with water was 4.17% +/- 2.54% (40.31 +/- 23.77 mgeq/sq cm). In the formulations mixed with peroxide, the total absorption was 3.41% +/- 1.32% (31.26 +/- 11.64 mgeq/sq cm) with the coupler and 3.44% +/- 2.84% (32.03 +/- 26.58 mgeq/sq cm) without the coupler.', 'The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of (14)C-toluene-2,5-diamine sulfate were investigated in rats in a series of studies...

Vehicle for the oral groups was water, whereas in the dermal group it was water/acetone (1:1). In the urine of the oral dose groups after 96 hours, the mean cumulative recovery of the applied dose was 62.2% in the 2.5-mg/kg dose group and 72.9% in the 25-mg/kg dose group, whereas in the feces, the recovery was 31.4% and 22.0%, respectively. The mean mass balance for both oral doses was about 98%. In the dermal application groups, 10.9% and 2.7% of the applied dose were recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. The mean mass balance for the dermal dose was nearly 100%. ...In plasma kinetics results, the time to peak concentration (Tmax) was 0.5 hours and 0.25 hours for the low- and high-dose oral groups, respectively, indicating rapid absorption.

Only 2.1% remained in the carcass.', 'The hydrolysis of di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate were studied using rat gut homogenate fractions in vitro. Both isomers were hydrolysed by the intestinal fraction; however di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate was hydrolysed to 2-ethylhexanol and mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate in about equal proportions whereas di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate was hydrolysed to 2-ethylhexanol and terephthalic acid. The half-lives for disappearance of the diesters were determined to be 12.6 min for di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and 53.3 min for di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate. 2. The absorption and metabolism of di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate were studied by administering (hexyl-(14)C)di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (in corn oil) by oral gavage at a dose level of 100 mg/kg to 10 adult male Sprague Dawley rats. Urine feces and expired air were collected for 144 hr and analysed for the presence of radioactivity and feces and urine were analysed for unlabelled metabolites. 3. Radioactivity was eliminated in feces (56.5 +/- 12.1% of dose) primarily as unchanged di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate, small amounts of mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and polar metabolites; excreted in urine (31.9 +/- 10.9% of dose) principally as mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and metabolic products of 2-ethylhexanol; and expired as (14)C02 (3.6 +/-0.9% of dose). Less than 2% of the administered radioactivity was found in the carcass. Small amounts of (14)C were found in the tissues with the highest amounts found in liver and fat. 4. Metabolites identified in urine included terephthalic acid (equivalent to 51% of dose), oxidized metabolites of 2-ethylhexanol and mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and glucuronic and sulfuric acid conjugates (equivalent to about 10% of dose). 5. These findings indicate that di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate was hydrolysed more extensively than di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and consequently the urinary metabolite profiles for these two isomeric plasticizers were very different. The hydrolysis and metabolism of di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate were found to be similar to those of di(2-ethylhexyl) adipate in that hydrolysis of both ester bonds occurs.']",,

Also, observation of elevated levels of the metabolite nitrate in the urine of rabbits receiving a dermal dose of 4,000 mg/kg/day supported the absorption of propylene glycol dinitrate after dermal exposure.', 'Exposure of monkeys to concentrations of 1.6 ppm and 4.2 ppm of propylene glycol dinitrate for 20 and 14 days, respectively, resulted in the detection of small amounts of propylene glycol dinitrate in plasma. During exposures to 1 .6 ppm, 35 ug/mL propylene glycol dinitrate was detected in plasma, and during exposures at 4.2 ppm, 170 ug/mL was detected in plasma.', 'In vitro studies using dog blood have shown that propylene glycol dinitrate preferentially associates with red blood cells in the blood.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for 1,2-PROPANEDIOL DINITRATE (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['The metabolism of /propylene glycol, 1,2-dinitrate/ (PGDN), as determined in vitro in blood and in vivo in rats, showed that 50% was broken down in 1 hr, and 50% of the remainder in the following hour. Small concentrations of inorganic nitrite were produced during incubation in blood, whereas inorganic nitrate accumulated. At the end of 3 hr, the first time it was measured, there were large amounts of propylene glycol 2-mononitrate (PGMN-2), together with small amounts of PGMN-1). The summed quantities of mononitrates, inorganic nitrate, and nitrite represented 95% of the initial amount added to blood. this metabolism occurred in the erythrocytes. In the intact rat, in contrast to in vitro in the blood, mononitrates undergo further degradation to nitrogen compounds other than the mononitrates and inorganic nitrate. Only 56% of the administered PGDN appeared in the urine as inorganic nitrate. THus, there is qualitatively little to distinguish the in vitro and in vivo metabolism of PGDN from that of /ethylene glycol dinitrate/ (EGDN). The only difference is that PGDN gives rise to two mononitrates and the 2-isomer is predominant, whereas EGDN gives rise only to /ethylene glycol mononitrate/. Quantitatively, there is less dinitrate and inorganic nitrite in the bloodstream after subcutaneous injection from PGDN than from a comparable injection of EGDN. Excretion was complete in 24 hr following a 65 mg/kg PGDN subcutaneous injection in rats.', 'Metabolic studies show that inorganic nitrate /is/ the major metabolite of propylene glycol dinitrate (PGDN) in rats administered 65 mg/kg subcutaneously; PGDN and nitrite were almost undetectable. Excretion was complete in 24 hours.', '... An effort was made to understand the oxidative process /which produces methemoglobin in vivo/ better and explain the role of hemoglobin in detoxifying nitrate esters. The reaction was nonenzymatic and first-order for dinitrate and O2Hb. The rate of oxidation proceeds linearly with dinitrate concentration and does not approach a limit as would be the case if it were enzymatically driven. The rate of oxidation is related complexly to the oxygen concentration. No oxidation occurs at zero oxygen concentration and none at very high concentrations. The stoichiometry was thought to be 1.5 hemes oxidized per ester bond broken in hemolysates and 1.9 to 2.3 per mole reacted ester in whole cells. From these studies, it was reasoned that hemoglobin would fulfill an important role in detoxifying the effects caused by the dinitrates. Hemoglobin in vivo, with the methemoglobin reductase system, acts catalytically to metabolize dinitrates to nitrite and nitrate, and the mononitrates are further degraded by the denitrifying tissue enzymes.', 'Subcutaneous injection of 65 mg/kg propylene glycol dinitrate in rats caused a rapid increase in blood levels of propylene glycol dinitrate.  Appearance of metabolites of propylene glycol dinitrate in the blood was maximal 2-4 hours postinjection and had declined to essentially zero by 8-12 hours postinjection. The predominant metabolite observed in the blood was nitrate, with propylene glycol 2-mononitrate observed at approximately one-half the concentration of inorganic nitrate. The levels of propylene glycol 1-mononitrate and inorganic nitrite were less than half that of propylene glycol 2-mononitrate.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for 1,2-PROPANEDIOL DINITRATE (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['The metabolism of /propylene glycol, 1,2-dinitrate/, as determined in vitro in blood and in vivo in rats, showed that 50% was broken down in 1 hr, and 50% of the remainder in the following hour.', 'For /intravenous/ doses of 0.3, 3, and 30 mg/kg /in rats/, the elimination half-time of propylene glycol dinitrate was 8.8, 13.1, and 17.4 hours, respectively.

For most tissue samples, there was no evidence of accumulation of DMDM Hydantoin or its metabolites. DMDM Hydantoin and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the urine. The amount of (14)C activity in the urine decreased approximately 6 times over a 72-hour period; radioactivity in the feces remained approximately constant and significantly below that of the urine.""]",,

Absorption also can occur through the skin or gastrointestinal tract.', 'Bioavailability via ingestion and by inhalation of one-micron particles approximates 80%, and 40 to 50%, respectively, of a parenterally delivered dose of BZ. Percutaneous absorption of BZ dissolved in propylene glycol yields, after a latent period of up to 24 hours, serum levels approximately 5 to 10% of those achieved with intravenous or intramuscular administration. ... Following absorption, BZ is systemically distributed to most organs and tissues of the body. Its ability to reach synapses and neuromuscular and neuroglandular junctions throughout the body is responsible for its peripheral nervous system (PNS) effects, whereas its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier confers upon it the ability to cause CNS effects. Atropine and hyoscyamine both cross the placenta and can be found in small quantities in breast milk; whether this is also true for BZ is unclear.', 'Most of the QNB that enters the body is excreted by the kidneys, making urine the choice for detection.']","['Information on the metabolism of BZ in humans is limited, but Benzylic Acid (BA) and 3-Quinuclidinol are the probable main metabolites ... .

Initial product formed from alkaloids that are esters of...retronecine (eg, jacobine...) is very probably the dehydroalkaloid. Dehydroalkaloids are highly reactive alkylating agents which react immediately with cell constituents to give soluble or bound secondary metabolites or which hydrolyze to dehydroaminoalcohol. /pyrrolizidine alkaloids/', 'The effect of prolonged phenobarbital (pb) administration on the toxicity of Senecio jacobaea (sj) was studied in sheep. Results suggested that mixed-function oxidase induction by pb does not increase the susceptibility of sheep to sj intoxication. Sheep possess a high activity of hepatic microsomal epoxide hydrolase which could account for their resistance to sj intoxication.', 'Comparison is made of the alkylating activities of a series of semi-synthetic pyrrole esters and pyrrole derivatives of pyrrolizidine alkaloids under pseudo-first-order reaction conditions. Data for alkylation by jacobine pyrrole (a reactive metabolite of jacobine) fit a simple first-order rate expression for product formation. The large increase in reaction rate for jacobine pyrrole is suggestive of an electronic field effect due to the epoxide ring in proximity to the C-7 ester moiety.']",

First, another group of rats (10 male Charles River CD (Crl CD(SD)Br) were treated with (14C)-DDAC at 50 mg/kg in order to obtain enough (14C) residues to use as standards. The (14C) metabolites were characterized by TLC, HPLC and MS. The second part of the experiment involved using the ""standard"" metabolic profiles to analyze the metabolites from feces samples obtained in the initial study. It was shown that metabolism tends to be sex specific. Females metabolize the parent compound more so than males. Metabolism, which may be microbial in nature, involved the oxidation of the 2 decyl side chains to form hydroxy and hydroxyketo derivatives. Modification of methyl substituents was not evident.']",

Thus, inhaled or swallowed material will be easily taken up. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/', 'In rats, the /gastrointestinal/ uptake of most of the organophosphorus pesticides reviewed seems to be rapid and efficient under test conditions usually involving a dose well below the LD50. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/']","['It is well-known that active metabolites of most organophosphorus insecticides react covalently to some extent with tissue esterases other than AChE. Since few of these esterases appear vital to health, the binding reaction may be considered a detoxification process. Although the catalytic activity of these esterases is high, the actual quantity of such sites is comparatively small. ... Binding was principally in liver and muscle. The quantity bound would not be expected to be much greater whatever the LD50 of an administered organophosphorus insecticide. Thus, it is a significant proportion of the total dose only for a very toxic compound such as paraoxon but not for compounds with much higher LD50s. However, the number of binding sites may, in some cases, be very significant compared with the quantity of circulating anticholinesterase oxon that has avoided other metabolic disposal processes. Molecules of oxon bound to these non-vital sites are prevented from attacking the vital sites such as AChE or NTE. Binding sites can therefore be considered an important second line of defense against intoxication. /Organophosphorus pesticides/', 'Metabolism occurs principally by oxidation, hydrolysis by esterases, and by transfer of portions of the molecule to glutathione.  Oxidation of organophosphorus insecticides may result in more or less toxic products.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products, that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Hydrolytic and transferase reactions affect both thioates and their oxons. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/']",

Iron has putative immune-enhancing, anticarcinogenic and cognition-enhancing activities.']",,"['The efficiency of absorption depends on the salt form, the amount administered, the dosing regimen and the size of iron stores. Subjects with normal iron stores absorb 10% to 35% of an iron dose. Those who are iron deficient may absorb up to 95% of an iron dose.', 'The disposition of iron is regulated by a complex mechanism to maintain homeostasis, mainly involving intake, stores, and loss. Generally, about 2-15% is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, whereas elimination of absorbed iron,is only about 0.01%/day (percent body burden or amount absorbed). Iron absorption is influenced by quantity and bioavailability of dietary iron, amount of storage iron, and rate of erythrocyte production. The best known enhancer is vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Dietary inhibitors of nonheme iron absorption include calcium phosphate, bran, phytic acid, and polyphenols present in some plants. During periods of increased iron need (childhood, pregnancy, or blood loss), absorption of iron is greatly increased. Absorption occurs in two steps: (1) absorption of ferrous ions from the intestinal lumen into the mucosal cells and (2) transfer from the mucosal cell to plasma, where it is bound to transferrin for transfer to storage sites. Transferrin is a beta1-globulin with a molecular weight of 75,000 and is produced in the liver. As ferrous ion is released into plasma, it becomes oxidized by oxygen in the presence of ferroxidase I, which is identical to ceruloplasmin. There are 3-5 g of iron in the body. About 2/3 is bound to hemoglobin, 10% in myoglobin and iron-containing enzymes, and the remainder is bound to the iron storage proteins ferritin and hemosiderin. Exposure to iron induces synthesis of apoferritin, which then binds ferrous ions. The ferrous ion becomes oxidized probably by histidine and cysteine residues and carbonyl groups. Iron may be released from ferritin by reducing agents. Ascorbic acid, cysteine, and reduced glutathione release iron slowly. Normally, excess ingested iron is excreted, and some is contained within shed intestinal cells and in bile and urine and in even smaller amounts in sweat, nails, and hair. Total iron excretion is usually on the order of 0.5 mg/day. /ferrous ions/', 'The body store of iron is divided between essential iron-containing compounds and  excess iron, which is held in storage. ... Hemoglobin dominates the essential fraction. ... The two predominant sites of iron storage are the reticuloendothelial system and the hepatocytes, although some storage also occurs in muscle ... . Internal exchange of iron is accomplished by the plasma protein transferrin. ... About 80% of the iron in plasma goes to the erythroid marrow to be packaged into new erythrocytes; these normally circulate for about 120 days before being catabolized by the reticuloendothelium. At that time a portion of the iron is immediately returned to the plasma bound to transferrin, while another portion is incorporated into the ferritin stores of the reticuloendothelial cell and is returned to the circulation more gradually. /Iron & iron salts/', 'The most remarkable feature of iron metabolism in man is the degree to which the body store is conserved. Only 10% of the total is lost per year from normal men, that is, about 1 mg per day ... . Two thirds of this iron is excreted from the GI tract as extravasated red cells, iron in bile, and iron in exfoliated mucosal cells. The other third is accounted for by small amounts of iron in desquamated skin and in the urine. ... The biochemical nature of the absorptive process is understood only in general terms ... . After acidification and partial digestion of food in the stomach, its content of iron is presented to the intestinal mucosa as either inorganic or heme iron. These fractions are taken up by the absorptive cells of the duodenum and upper small intestine, and the iron is either transported directly into the plasma or is stored as mucosal ferritin. ... Normal absorption is about 1 mg per day in the adult male and 1.4 mg per day in the adult female. /Iron & iron salts/', 'Substantial amounts of many metals are excreted in the sweat, including ... iron. ... The potential exists, depending on sweat rates and acclimatization, for substantial losses of these metals in sweat. /Iron salts/', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for IRON COMPOUNDS (23 total), please visit the HSDB record page.', '/The researchers/ goal is to develop, characterize and optimize functionalized super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) demonstrating the capacity to be internalized by human cancer cells. SPION (mean diameter 9 nm) were coated with various ratios to iron oxide of either polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), carboxylate-functionalized PVA, thiol-functionalized PVA and amino-functionalized PVA (amino-PVA). The interaction with cells and cytotoxicity of the SPION preparations were determined using human melanoma cells. From the four functionalized SPION preparations, only the amino-PVA SPION demonstrated the capacity to interact with, and were not cytotoxic to, human melanoma cells. This interaction with melanoma cells was dependent on the amino-PVA to iron oxide ratio, was an active and saturable mechanism displayed by all cells in a culture. These functionalized SPION were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and electrophoretic mobility. The physical comportment of SPION changed at specific PVAs to iron oxide ratios, and this ratio corresponded to the ratio of optimal interaction with cells. In conclusion, the successful development of functionalized SPION displaying potential cellular uptake by human cancer cells depends both on the presence of amino groups on the coating shell of the nanoparticles and of its ratio to the amount of iron oxide. /Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/', 'Poly-L-lysine-modified iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP-PLL), which is formed by modifying poly-L-lysine to the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles, can deliver exogenous genes to cells in vitro and in vivo. However, there is relatively little information available about how is IONP-PLL uptaken by cells. In this study, /the researchers/ are focusing on the transferrin receptor (TFR) mediated and TFR-independent cellular internalization of IONP-PLL. The cells were incubated with 1 uM of IONP-PLL with or without transferrin bound. Transferrin-TFR pathway blockers, such as NH4 Cl, CH3 NH2 , or trypsin, were added to the media and their effects were observed. Atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to quantify the cellular concentration of iron. The cellular concentrations of iron were evaluated at 37 °C or 4 °C. (1) Transferrin-IONP-PLL uptake into cells was reliant on time and temperature. (2) The addition of blockers, either NH4 CL, CH3 NH2 , or trypsin, decreased the cellular transferrin-dependent IONP-PLL uptake, but not completely blocked the entry of IONP-PLL. (3) When the cells were culture at pH 6.5, under conditions which the binding of iron and transferrin were inhibited, IONP-PLL still had the capacity to enter into cells with time and temperature-dependent manner. These results suggest that the cellular internalization of IONP-PLL, much like iron ion, were mediated by TFR-dependent endocytosis and TFR-free uptake. /Poly-L-lysine-modified iron oxide nanoparticles/', 'Nanoparticles (NPs) are being used or explored for the development of biomedical applications in diagnosis and therapy, including imaging and drug delivery. Therefore, reliable tools are needed to study the behavior of NPs in biological environment, in particular the transport of NPs across biological barriers, including the blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB), a challenging question. Previous studies have addressed the translocation of NPs of various compositions across cell layers, mostly using only one type of cells. Using a co-culture model of the human BBTB, consisting in human cerebral endothelial cells preloaded with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIO NPs) and unloaded human glioblastoma cells grown on each side of newly developed ultrathin permeable silicon nitride supports as a model of the human BBTB, /the researchers/ demonstrate ... the transfer of USPIO NPs from human brain-derived endothelial cells to glioblastoma cells. The reduced thickness of the permeable mechanical support compares better than commercially available polymeric supports to the thickness of the basement membrane of the cerebral vascular system. These results ... support the possibility that USPIO NPs could be directly transferred from endothelial cells to glioblastoma cells across a BBTB. Thus, the use of such ultrathin porous supports provides a new in vitro approach to study the delivery of nanotherapeutics to brain cancers. /The/ results also suggest a novel possibility for nanoparticles to deliver therapeutics to the brain using endothelial to neural cells transfer. /Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/', 'Superparamagnetic iron-oxide particles (SPIO) are used in different ways as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Particles with high nonspecific uptake are required for unspecific labeling of phagocytic cells whereas those that target specific molecules need to have very low unspecific cellular uptake. /The researchers/ compared iron-oxide particles with different core materials (magnetite, maghemite), different coatings (none, dextran, carboxydextran, polystyrene) and different hydrodynamic diameters (20-850 nm) for internalization kinetics, release of internalized particles, toxicity, localization of particles and ability to generate contrast in MRI. Particle uptake was investigated with U118 glioma cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which exhibit different phagocytic properties. In both cell types, the contrast agents Resovist, B102, non-coated Fe(3)O(4) particles and microspheres were better internalized than dextran-coated Nanomag particles. SPIO uptake into the cells increased with particle/iron concentrations. Maximum intracellular accumulation of iron particles was observed between 24 hr to 36 hr of exposure. Most particles were retained in the cells for at least two weeks, were deeply internalized, and only few remained adsorbed at the cell surface. Internalized particles clustered in the cytosol of the cells. Furthermore, all particles showed a low toxicity. By MRI, monolayers consisting of 5000 Resovist-labeled cells could easily be visualized. Thus, for unspecific cell labeling, Resovist and microspheres show the highest potential, whereas Nanomag particles are promising contrast agents for target-specific labeling. /Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles/']","['Iron metabolism occurs in a virtually closed system.

This study investigated the tissue distribution of manganese in iron-sufficient and iron-deficient rats after welding-fume exposure. The feeding of an iron-deficient diet for 4 wk produced a depletion of body iron, such as decreased iron levels in the serum and tissues, and upregulated the divalent metal transporter 1 expression in the rat duodenum. The iron-sufficient and iron-deficient rats were then exposed to welding fumes generated from manual metal arc stainless steel at a concentration of 63.5 +/- 2.3 mg/cu m for 2 hr per day over a 30-day period. Animals were sacrificed on days 1, 15, and 30. The level of body iron in the iron-deficient rats was restored to the control level after the welding-fume exposure. However, the tissue distributions of manganese after the welding-fume exposure showed similar patterns in both the iron-sufficient and iron-deficient groups. The concentration of manganese increased in the lungs and liver on days 15 and 30, and increased in the olfactory bulb on day 30. Slight and heterogeneous increases of manganese were observed in different brain regions. Consequently, these findings suggest that the presence of Fe in the inhaled welding fumes may not have a significant effect on the uptake of Mn into the brain. Thus, the condition of iron deficiency did not seem to have any apparent effect on the transport of Mn into the brain after the inhalation of welding fumes.', '... To investigate the movement of manganese after welding-fume exposure, six cynomolgus monkeys were acclimated and assigned to three dose groups: unexposed, low dose (31 mg/cu m total suspended particulate [TSP], 0.9 mg/cu m of Mn), and high dose (62 mg/cu m TSP, 1.95 mg/cu m of Mn) of total suspended particulate. The primates were exposed to manual metal arc stainless steel (MMA-SS) welding fumes for 2 hr per day in an inhalation chamber system equipped with an automatic fume generator. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were conducted before the initiation of exposure and thereafter every month. The tissue Mn concentrations were then measured after a plateau was reached regarding the shortening of the MRI T1 relaxation time. A dose-dependent increase in the Mn concentration was found in the lungs, while noticeable increases in the Mn concentrations were found in certain tissues, such as the liver, kidneys, and testes. Slight increases in the Mn concentrations were found in the caudate, putamen, frontal lobe, and substantia nigra, while a dose-dependent noticeable increase was only found in the globus pallidus. Therefore, the present results indicated that a shortening of the MRI T1 relaxation time corresponded well with the Mn concentration in the globus pallidus after prolonged welding-fume exposure.']",,"['Whole body: 2-5 weeks depending on body stores; [TDR, p. 803]']"

More recent studies have determined different absorption rates for various populations based on their type of diet and phytate to zinc molar ratio. Zinc absorption is concentration dependent and increases  linearly with  dietary zinc up to a maximum rate.  Additionally zinc status may influence zinc absorption. Zinc-deprived humans absorb this element with increased efficiency, whereas humans on a high-zinc diet show a reduced efficiency of absorption.', 'The excretion of zinc through gastrointestinal tract accounts for approximately one-half of all zinc eliminated from the body.   Considerable amounts of zinc are secreted through both biliary and intestinal secretions, however most is reabsorbed. This is an important process in the regulation of zinc balance.

Zinc has been shown to induce intestinal metallothionein, which combines zinc and copper in the intestine and prevents their serosal surface transfer. Intestinal cells are sloughed with approximately a 6-day turnover, and the metallothionein-bound copper and zinc are lost in the stool and are thus not absorbed.

Lesser sites of localization were the endocardium of the AV heart valves, the glassy membranes of the larger hairs of the coat, the zona pellucida of the Graafian follicles and the zona arcuata of the adrenal cortex. With the exception of the liver, where the radionuclide was principally within the hepatic cells, most of the deposition sites were extracellular, within or associated with connective tissue which gave a positive periodic acid-Schiff reaction. /Californium-249 and berkelinium-249 citrates/', 'Beagles were injected with californium-249 or californium-252 in citrate buffer. The concentration of nuclide in plasma and whole blood was measured from 5 min to 48 hr post injection. Small amounts of californium were found associated with the cellular elements. The concentration of californium in plasma decreased rapidly during the first few hours after injection. At 24 hr post injection less than 1 % of the injected dose was circulating. Californium-249 and -252 disappeared from the circulation at the same rate. Separation of plasma constituents by gel filtration demonstrated that californium in plasma was associated with compounds with a molecular weight of approximately 70,000. Additional information obtained by ion exchange chromatography indicated that this protein was transferrin. Data obtained in vivo from canines were extended by in vitro experiments with human blood. Gel chromatography of human plasma protein incubated in vitro with californium indicated that a californium protein complex was formed and appeared to be nearly identical to that seen in dogs. Re-chromatography of these fractions on DEAE-Sephadex showed that transferrin and californium did not coincide exactly. Thus californium-transferrin is either held more tenaciously by the ion exchange resin than iron-transferrin or apo-transferrin, or the shift was caused by the presence of another as yet un-identified minor protein component. The stability of the protein complex(s) formed is less than that of the plutonium-transferrin complex and this decreased stability is responsible for the high rate of its disappearance from the bloodstream. /Californium-249 and californium-252 citrates/', 'Young adult beagles are given single intravenous injections of monomeric californium-252, californium-249, americium-24, plutonium-239, thorium-228, radium-226, radium-228 or strontium-90 in citrate solution to achieve reproducible deposition patterns in tissue. Injected transuranium atoms become attached to transferrin and other substances in blood plasma. The skeleton and liver are the primary sites of deposition, although high local concentrations of californium, berkelium and americium also occur in the thyroid and kidney, and radium also concentrates in the eye. The initial skeletal deposition of monomeric transuranium elements is on bone surfaces. The mean local dose-rate to the soft-tissue layer 0-10 mi from the mineralized bone surfaces of the beagle is about 20 times higher when 239-Pu is on bone surfaces than for an equal amount of 239-Pu randomly distributed throughout the bone mineral. Thus, the rate of bone-surface remodeling has a very important influence on the skeletal toxicity of the transuranium elements. The initial liver deposition of monomeric transuranium elements is rather uniform and mainly in the hepatic cells. Subsequently, much of the radioactivity shifts into the liver reticulo-endothelial cells that line the sinusoids. At long times after injection, the distribution is very non-uniform, being highest in the portal region and lowest in the regenerative nodules...  /Californium-252, californium-249, americium-24, plutonium-239, thorium-228, radium-226, radium-228 or strontium-90 citrates/', 'Radioactive atoms of radionuclides of the actinide and lanthanide series and other easily hydrolyzable metallic radionuclides ... may tend to aggregate and concentrate within lysosomes.

There was no significant difference (p= 0.05) between episodic aluminum levels and episodic blank (no fish) aluminum levels, indicating that the flow rate through the chambers was sufficient to maintain aluminum levels such that absorption of aluminum from the apparatus was negligible.

Cadmium injection significantly stimulated serum ceruloplasmin activity and copper concentration, accompanied by an increase in hepatic copper. Lead injection also slightly increased the serum ceruloplasmin level. In contrast, silver injection markedly decreased both serum ceruloplasmin activity and copper concentration in the serum. Hepatic copper increased slightly after silver injection. The copper injection stimulated copper binding to metallothionein and bile excretion of copper, but not serum ceruloplasmin release. With a copper and silver combination, the effect of silver on serum ceruloplasmin was lost, with a concomitant disappearance of silver from the serum ceruloplasmin fraction in the serum. In the mouse, cadmium and silver, copper antagonistic metals, influence different sites of serum ceruloplasmin metabolism. Excess hepatic copper is partly eliminated by excretion of bile and is partly detoxified by metallothionein induction.']",,

Both the in vitro metabolism of (3H)6-Nitrochrysene (NC) by 9000 g supernatants (S9) prepared from the livers of preweanling mice and the in vivo metabolism of (3H)NC in these animals. The in vitro covalent binding of primary metabolites of NC to DNA after further reductive and/or oxidative metabolism was then examined in an attempt to define the metabolic activation pathway responsible for the formation of carcinogen--DNA adducts in NC-treated preweanling mice. NC-1,2-dihydrodiol, NC-9,10-dihydrodiol, 6-aminochrysene (AC), and several unidentified compounds were found in ethyl acetate extracts of incubations containing (3H)NC and liver S9 from 1- or 8-day-old BLU:Ha mice. Comparison of the in vivo metabolism of NC in 1-day-old animals and 8-day-old animals which had been treated with NC on day 1 indicated that the formation of AC and the two NC dihydrodiols was greater in the younger animals. Further metabolism of NC-1,2-dihydrodiol by S9 from 8-day-old mice yielded AC-1,2-dihydrodiol as a major product. Incubation of AC-1,2-dihydrodiol, calf thymus DNA and liver microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-induced rats yielded a single major adduct that was chromatographically and chemically identical to the major adduct formed in (3H)NC- and (3H)-AC-treated preweanling mice. The results indicated that the major DNA adduct found in vivo is derived from the further metabolism of the proximate carcinogen AC-1,2-dihydrodiol.', '... The major metabolic activation pathway of 6-nitrochrysene in newborn mice is initially through the formation of the proximate tumorigen trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-6-aminochrysene with subsequent formation of 1,2-dihydroxy-3,4-epoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-aminochrysene ... The ability of human hepatic and pulmonary microsomes to metabolize 6-nitrochrysene was investigated. The major metabolites identified in 11 hepatic microsomes were trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-6-nitrochrysene, trans-9,10-dihydro-9,10-dihydroxy-6-nitrochrysene, trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-6-aminochrysene, 6-aminochrysene, and chrysene-5,6-quinone. Following the incubations of 6-nitrochrysene with 11 different human pulmonary microsomes, qualitatively similar metabolic patterns were obtained, although quantitative differences were evident. These results demonstrated that human liver and lung are capable of metabolizing 6-nitrochrysene to known potent carcinogenic metabolites via ring oxidation and nitroreduction. In an attempt to define the roles of individual human hepatic P450 involved in the metabolism of 6-nitrochrysene, the catalytic activities known to be associated with a specific P450 were analyzed and compared with the levels of each metabolite of 6-nitrochrysene formed with the same microsomes. Rates of phenacetin O-deethylation (P450 1A2) and nifedipine oxidation (P450 3A4) were well correlated with the rates of formation of trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-6-nitrochrysene and 6-aminochrysene, respectively. Inhibition studies with specific P450 inhibitors and antibodies further support the view that P450 1A2 and P450 3A4 are the major forms responsible for the formation of trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-6-nitrochrysene and 6-aminochrysene, respectively, in human liver. Further metabolism of trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-6-nitrochrysene appears to require P450 3A4. In the human lung, P450 1A1 appears to play a major role in the metabolism of 6-nitrochrysene to trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-6-nitrochrysene ...', '... Three female CD rats were injected ip with [3,4,9,10-3H]6-nitrochrysene (6-NC) [9 umol/rat (346 uCi/rat)], and urine and feces were collected daily for 3 days. In the first 24 hr, radioactivity corresponding to 1.3% of the dose was excreted in the urine, whereas 23.0% was recovered in the feces. After 3 days, the total excretions in urine and feces were 2.8% and 34.9% of the dose, respectively. Radioactivity measured in various organs 3 days after injection of [3,4,9,10-3H]6-NC amounted to 24.8% of the administered dose. Fecal metabolites were identified, based on comparison of their chromatographic characteristics with those of standards, as trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-6-NC, chrysene-5,6-quinone, and 6-aminochrysene (6-AC); the structure of the latter was further confirmed by mass spectrometry and UV spectral analysis. Metabolites identified in the urine were 6-AC, trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-6-NC, and trans-9,10-dihydro-9,10-dihydroxy-6-NC in free forms and also as glucuronide and/or sulfate conjugates. The (32)P-postlabeling assay was used to determine the metabolic pathways that were leading to DNA adduct formation in the target (colon) and nontarget (liver, lung, and mammary tissues) organs of female CD rats injected with 6-NC under conditions identical to those of the bioassay (total, 14.8 umol/rat; single ip injections on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29). Twenty-four hr after the last carcinogen administration, the levels of the adduct derived from trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-6-AC were higher than those derived from N-hydroxy-6-AC in all organs examined; however, the highest levels of DNA adducts were found in the lung and not in the target organ, the colon. Although the role of each adduct in colon carcinogenesis needs to be determined, the results favor the ring oxidation and nitroreduction combination pathway as the primary contributor to the activation of 6-NC as a colon carcinogen in the rat.', ""The environmental pollutant 6-nitrochrysene (6-NC) is a potent mammary carcinogen in the rat.

Cytochrome P450-dependent oxidation represents a minor pathway accounting for the formation of 1,1-dichloro compounds after chlorine migration. The major pathway is the biosynthesis of toxic glutathione conjugates. Organ-specific toxicity and carcinogenicity of dichloroethyne (acetylene dichloride) is due most likely to the topographical distribution of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase which is concentrated mainly in the kidney of rats.', 'The metabolism of inhaled 14(C)dichloroacetylene has been studied in male Wistar rats exposed to 20 or 40 ppm (78 or 156 mg/cu m) atmospheres for 1 hr. During the next 96 hr, elimination of retained (approximately 17%) 20 and 40 ppm doses, respectively, was: urine, 68% and 60%; feces, 28% and 27%. About 3.5% remained in the carcasses. Metabolites of dichloroacetylene that were identified were: N-acetyl-S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)- L-cysteine (62%), dichloroethanol (12%), dichloroacetic acid (9%), oxalic acid (8%) and chloroacetic acid (5%) in urine; and N-acetyl-S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine in faeces. In bile, only S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)glutathione was identified. Biliary cannulation did not influence the renal excretion of N-acetyl-S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine, a result that was interpreted to indicate that glutathione conjugation also occurs in the kidney. The identified metabolites are consistent with the existence of two metabolic pathways: the major pathway involves glutathione conjugation, while a minor pathway is cytochrome P450-dependent oxidation that accounts for the formation of 1,1- dichloro-compounds after chlorine migration.', 'In vitro studies have demonstrated that glutathione conjugation of dichloroacetylene is predominantly enzymatic and the rate of reaction resulting in the formation of S-(1,2- dichlorovinyl)glutathione is similar for microsomes from rat kidney and liver. However, under different reaction conditions (20-500-fold higher protein concentrations), the rate was highest for microsomes from liver, followed by lung, brain and kidney. The further handling of this metabolite in kidney is not clearly defined, but it is known that gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and dipeptidases (e.g., in biliary epithelium) can transform S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)glutathione to S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)- L-cysteine, which can then be acetylated in tissues or by intestinal bacteria . An alternative to acetylation is beta-lyase-mediated metabolism to form chlorothioketene as an intermediate, which can react with tissue nucleophiles or with water, when it forms chloroacetic acid. Cysteine conjugate beta-lyase activity has also been shown in rat cerebellar tissue.', 'The glutathione (GSH) dependent metabolism of dichloroacetylene (DCA) was investigated in rat liver and kidney subcellular fractions. The study also included the metabolism of DCA in rats to identify and quantify any metabolites formed by GSH conjugation. S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)glutathione (DCVG) was identified as a product of the in-vitro metabolism and N-acetyl-S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (N-Ac-DCVC) was identified as a urinary metabolite of DCA in rats. ...N-Ac-DCVC was identified as a urinary metabolite from rats by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry after esterification. Male rats exposed to 36 ppm DCA for 1 hr produced urine which contained 10.7 micromoles of N-Ca-DCVC as determined by high pressure liquid chromatographic analysis. .../It was suggested/ that the formation of DCVG, renal processing to cysteine S-conjugate beta-lyase in the kidney with formation of reactive and mutagenic intermediates may account for DCA nephrotoxicity and nephrocarcinogenicity.']",

The initial deposition of silica was highest in the tracheobronchial ciliated air passages; it also was seen throughout the acini, where the extent of deposition decreased as the respiratory airways proceeded distally. The distribution of particles was not uniform between the different acini, and, 2 to 3 months following cessation of exposure, aggregates were formed, primarily in the proximal alveolar ducts but also in the distal portion of the acini.', 'Inhalation studies with rats... indicate that the long-term clearance of quartz after inhalation is slow and biphasic, whereas amorphous silica dusts are cleared more rapidly. The absolute amount of silica dust eliminated increased with lung burden, but the efficiency of the elimination was either constant or decreased with time. ...The half-life lung clearance of rats exposed via inhalation to an amorphous silica suspension (Ludox ) at concentrations up to 150 mg/cu m was about 50 days.', 'A study /in (1983)/, showed that the total silica content in the lungs of guinea pigs exposed by inhalation for up to 2 years to a cristobalite sample or to amorphous silica (at dust concentrations of 150 mg/cu m or 100 mg/cu m , respectively) increased linearly over 21 months, without evidence that lung retention rates changed with time. ...The maximum lung content of cristobalite was only 68 mg/lung, whereas that of amorphous silica was 120 mg/lung. The total amount of accumulated silica varied inversely with the degree of pulmonary damage. /It was/ suggested that silica dust producing cell damage may be more efficiently cleared from the lung than are the less toxic amorphous forms. However, this difference also could be due to different rates of deposition for the two dust forms. The cristobalite sample, which was 45% cristobalite and 55% diatomaceous earth, was significantly coarser (and less likely to deposit in the lungs) than the amorphous silica, which contained 100% diatomaceous earth. Also, tissue changes induced by cristobalite could have altered particle deposition.', 'In a long-term inhalation study with guinea pigs, ...the amount of silica retained as a result of 8-hr/day exposures to amorphous silica (Hi-Sil 233) /was compared/ with that retained during inhalation of quartz dust for a comparable 12-month period. Guinea pigs that inhaled quartz dust at a concentration of 106 mg/cu m retained between 500 and 600 mg of silica, whereas <10 mg of dust was retained in those that inhaled 126 mg/cu m of amorphous silica. After 12 months of exposure, the relative silica content (silica mass/lung mass) decreased in guinea pigs exposed to quartz dust, but continued to increase slowly in the animals exposed to the amorphous silica. This difference was explained by an increasing nonsiliceous materials content (e.g., collagen, minerals) in the lungs of the quartz-exposed animals associated with the progressive deposition of fibrous tissue in the lungs. Six months after cessation of exposure, the silica content of the lungs of Hi-Sil 233-exposed animals was similar to that of untreated controls. This lack of accumulation may be due, in large part, to the higher solubility of amorphous silica compared to quartz... . By comparison, the elimination of silica from the quartz-exposed guinea pigs was negligible, and the silicotic lesions continued to progress during this elimination phase.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for AMORPHOUS SILICA (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.', 'Rats were exposed for 6 hr/day, on 5 days/week, for up to 13 weeks to 3 mg/cu m crystalline... Lung burdens were 819... ug for crystalline...', 'Deposition of particles in the respiratory bronchioles and proximal alveoli results in slow clearance, interaction with macrophages and a greater likelihood of lung injury. This contrasts with deposition on the conducting airways where the majority of the particles are cleared by the mucociliary escalator. Therefore, quartz particles with an aerodynamic diameter below 10 um are likely to be the most harmful to humans.', 'There are few data on human lung quartz-dust burdens that allow conclusions to be drawn about deposition or clearance. However, quartz is found in the bronchoalveolar macrophages and sputum of silicotic patients. Also, at autopsy, there is wide variation in the masses and proportions of quartz retained in the lung. For example... 25-264 mg /were reported/ per single lung at autopsy in hard-rock miners with 14-36 years of exposure; these miners had variable amounts of pathological response but there was not a good correlation between lung crystalline quartz content and pathological score. The well-documented effect of smoking on clearance is a further confounding factor in drawing conclusions about clearance kinetics in humans.', ""The physico-chemical changes in quartz that result from residence in the lung could be an important factor in determining the continuing toxicity of quartz to the lung following deposition. As a response to the rejection of the 'mechanical model' of silicosis, which had propounded that any particle with 'sharp or jagged edges' might injure tissue, a solubility theory of silicosis was proposed. The solubility theory was based on the release from silica of silicic acid, which was considered to be a 'protoplasmic poison.'  In fact very little dissolution occurs; for example, 9 mg SiO2 (0.45%) was released from 2 g crystalline silica placed in ascitic fluid for two weeks. Current theories no longer consider that the dissolution of quartz contributes substantially to its clearance or to changes in its biological activity. Indeed there is evidence of enrichment of crystalline silica in lungs of individuals exposed to hard rock compared to the dust in the air they breathed, suggesting that crystalline silica is less-efficiently cleared, either by dissolution or mechanical clearance, than the non-silica mineral components of the dust... biopersistence was assessed in occupationally exposed subjects by counting silica particles in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid after varying periods of time since their last occupational exposure.

Nitrate then enters the large bowel from the blood, where it is rapidly converted to highly reactive nitrite, in part by fecal microorganisms. The formed nitrite is reabsorbed into the blood, where it reacts with the ferrous (Fe2+) iron of deoxyhemoglobin, forming methemoglobin with iron in the ferric (Fe3+) valence state. Ferric iron is unable to transport oxygen. Nitrates are rapidly converted in the liver to denitrated metabolites and inorganic nitrites, which are then excreted in urine. Approximately 60% to 70% of an ingested nitrate dose is excreted in urine within the first 24 hours. About 25% is excreted in saliva through an active blood nitrate transport system and potentially is reabsorbed. Half-lives of parent nitrate compounds are usually <1 hour; half-lives of metabolites range from 1 to 8 hours. /Nitrates/', '... Nitrate is concentrated in saliva, where a part of it is reduced to nitrite by bacterial nitrate reductases. /The authors/ tested if ingestion of inorganic nitrate would affect the salivary and systemic levels of nitrite and S-nitrosothiols, both considered to be circulating storage pools for NO. Levels of nitrate, nitrite, and S-nitrosothiols were measured in plasma, saliva, and urine before and after ingestion of sodium nitrate (10 mg/kg). Nitrate levels increased greatly in saliva, plasma, and urine after the nitrate load. Salivary S-nitrosothiols also increased, but plasma levels remained unchanged. A 4-fold increase in plasma nitrite was observed after nitrate ingestion. If, however, the test persons avoided swallowing after the nitrate load, the increase in plasma nitrite was prevented, thereby illustrating its salivary origin. We show that nitrate is a substrate for systemic generation of nitrite. There are several pathways to further reduce this nitrite to NO. These results challenge the dogma that nitrate is biologically inert and instead suggest that a complete reverse pathway for generation of NO from nitrate exists.', 'Nitrite was quickly eliminated from blood plasma of sheep (T1/2 = 0.49 hr). Three hours after its administration, nitrite ion disappeared from blood plasma. Simultaneously the appearance of nitrate was observed. After sodium nitrite or nitrate intravenous administration, the kinetic parameters for nitrate were similar (Kel = 0.150/ h and 0.154/ hr, respectively). Urine excretion of nitrite amounted to only 0.29%+/- 0.22 of the administered dose. Urine excretion of nitrate was 13.80%+/-5.78 of the administered dose of nitrite and was slightly lower than that observed after the administration of nitrate (16.12%+/- 6.95). The quick elimination of nitrite appears to be mainly from its conversion into nitrate, because the nitrate elimination in urine. as well as the values of its kinetic parameters, were similar after the administration of nitrite or nitrate.

Normally methemoglobin gradually reverts to hemoglobin through enzymatic reactions. Nitrite has vasodilating properties, probably through transformation into nitric oxide (NO) or a NO-containing molecule acting as a signal factor for smooth muscle relaxation. Nitrite easily transforms into a nitrosating agent in an acidic environment and can react with a variety of compounds, eg ascorbic acid, amines, amides.

An average of 3% of the radioactivity of week-old fallout was absorbed: the range was 0-9%.', 'Data were obtained for the distribution-excretion pattern of 137Cs in guinea pigs over a period of 100 days after administration by three different routes. Three groups of twenty guinea pigs were used. Solutions of cesium chloride containing 137Cs as a tracer were administered to the animals by inhalation, by ingestion and by i.p. injection. Urine and feces were collected daily until sacrifice, and the time-tissue distribution patterns were determined after death. All measurements were made by gamma counting with a NaI (Tl) detector. Since cesium chloride is extremely soluble, it was absorbed rapidly from the lungs, the digestive tract and the abdominal cavity. After the first day, the skeletal muscle had the largest concentration of 137Cs. Its retention in muscle may be approximated by a single exponential function with an average biological half-life of 10 days. Concentration in other tissues did not differ significantly from that in the muscle. The 137Cs concentration in total excretion followed an exponential pattern with a rapidly and a slowly decreasing component. The average urine-to-feces ratio was 2.8. More than 95 per cent was excreted within 32 days; at this time, approximately 65 per cent of the remaining radioactivity was located in the skeletal muscle.', 'Absorption of CsCl, SrCl2, BaCl2 and CeCl3 deposited on nasal membranes directly into the general circulation was studied in Syrian hamsters and compared with gastrointestinal tract absorption.

For all isotopes, nasal absorption was approximately = or >gastrointestinal absorption during the first 4 hr after administration.

Oral iron supplements are absorbed up to 60% via active and passive transport processes. Gastrointestinal absorption of iron occurs via strict regulation by the enterocyte and duodenal cytochrome and ferric reductase enzymes. The hormone hepcidin heavily regulates iron absorption and distribution throughout the body.  The median time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) is generally 4 hours after administration. Between 2-8 hours post administration, average serum iron concentrations fluctuate by 20%, according to one study. Bioavailability of iron depends on whether it is administered in a film coated tablet or enteric coated tablet. One pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers revealed a 30% bioavailability for enteric coated tablets. The AUC of enteric coated tablets varied between a lower limit of -46.93 to 5.25 µmolxh/l. Cmax is higher for film coated tablets, ranging from 3.4 to 22.1 µmol/h/l.  It is advisable to take ferrous sulfate with ascorbic acid, as this practice may increase absorption.  Avoid antacids, tea, coffee,tea, dairy products, eggs, and whole-grain bread for at least an hour after taking ferrous sulfate. Calcium can decrease iron absorption by 33% if taken concomitantly.', 'Oral iron is recycled, with some loss in the urine, sweat, and desquamation.

The remainder of the iron is found in muscle tissues (as a part of myoglobin), and in a variety of different enzymes, as well as in storage form. Most stored iron is in the form of ferritin, which can be found in the liver, bone marrow, spleen and, and muscle. Iron crosses the placenta and is also found in breast milk.', '... The bioavailability studies were carried out using four groups of 30 female mice each. In two groups, we studied the absorption of ferrous ascorbate and ferrous sulfate, both in water as reference standards, which show absorptions of 13.1+/-4.9% and 13.2+/-4.3%, respectively. With the third group, we studied the absorption of ferrous sulfate in milk; its value, 7.9+/-3.2%, is significantly lower than that of the remaining groups, with a p < 0.01. The studies with SFE-171 in milk, were performed on the fourth group, with a result of 11.6+/-4.5%, demonstrating that its absorption does not differ significantly from that of the reference standards. The absorption mechanism was determined by means of in vivo self-displacement studies of the ferrous ion and the SFE-171, taking ferrous sulfate as the reference compound. For this study, 210 female mice were used, and no significant difference between the absorption mechanism of both products could be observed.', 'We investigated the iron bioavailability of microencapsulated ferrous sulfate (SFE-171) in a diet based on powdered milk by using the prophylactic method in rats.The SFE-171 was added into fluid milk and industrially processed into powdered milk, which was then mixed in our laboratory with a normalized diet (17.2 +/- 2.1 mg Fe/kg). A reference standard diet using ferrous sulfate as iron-fortifying source (19.8 p+/- 2.9 mg Fe/kg) and a control diet without added iron (4.6 +/- 0.8 mg Fe/kg) were prepared in the laboratory in a similar way. These diets were administered to different groups of weaning rats for 28 d as the only solid nourishment. The iron bioavailability of the different sources was calculated as the relation between the mass of iron incorporated into hemoglobin during the treatment and the total iron intake per animal.

Normally, iron exists in the ferrous (Fe2+) or ferric (Fe3+) state, but since Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+, which hydrolyzes to insoluble iron(III)hydroxides in neutral aqueous solutions, iron binds to plasma proteins and is either transported or stored throughout the body.  There are three proteins that serve to regulate the storage and transport of ingested iron. The first protein , transferrin, transports iron in both the plasma and extracellular fluid. Ceruloplasmin in the plasma and hephaestin on the enterocyte participate in the oxidation and binding of iron to transferrin. The main role of transferrin is the chelation of iron to prevent the production of reactive oxygen species, while facilitating its transport into cells.   The transferrin receptor, located on many cells that require iron, binds the transferrin complex and internalizes this complex. Ferritin is a protein that stores iron, making it readily available for body requirements.']","['The half-life of orally administered iron is not readily available in the literature, with total effects lasting 2-4 months (congruent with the red blood cell life span) with an onset of action of 4 days and peak activity at 7-10 days.']"

Potassium nitrates are ignitable fumigants also utilized as rodenticides and insecticides. They are added to other pesticide active ingredients (sulfur and carbon) and placed into fumigant gas cartridges, designed to be ignited and placed in pest-infested areas. The activated cartridge bombs release toxic gases which are lethal to select rodents, skunks, coyotes, and wasps.  Potassium ions have demonstrated in animal studies to act directly on the nerves and to reduce sensory activity.

The main site for this reaction is mouth and stomach, but nitrite formation in the lower intestine and in the bladder (urinary infection) may also be of some toxicological importance.  Nitrite may be further reduced to nitrogen by bacteria under some conditions. In blood, nitrite transforms hemoglobin to methemoglobin and is simultaneously oxidized to nitrate. Normally methemoglobin gradually reverts to hemoglobin through enzymatic reactions. Nitrite has vasodilating properties, probably through transformation into nitric oxide (NO) or a NO-containing molecule acting as a signal factor for smooth muscle relaxation. Nitrite easily transforms into a nitrosating agent in an acidic environment and can react with a variety of compounds, eg ascorbic acid, amines, amides. Nitrosation can also be mediated by bacteria, eg in the stomach. Some reaction products are carcinogenic (eg most nitrosoamines and amides). /Nitrate and nitrite/', 'BACKGROUND/AIMS: It has been suggested that dietary nitrate, after concentration in the saliva and reduction to nitrite by tongue surface bacteria, is chemically reduced to nitric oxide (NO) in the acidic conditions of the stomach. This study aimed to quantify this in humans. METHODS: Ten healthy fasting volunteers were studied twice, after oral administration of 2 mmol of potassium nitrate or potassium chloride. Plasma, salivary and gastric nitrate, salivary and gastric nitrite, and gastric headspace NO concentrations were measured over six hours. RESULTS: On the control day the parameters measured varied little from basal values. Gastric nitrate concentration was 105.3+/-13 umol/L (mean (SEM), plasma nitrate concentration was 17.9+/-2.4 umol/L, salivary nitrate concentration 92.6+/-31.6 umol/L, and nitrite concentration 53.9+/-22.8 umol/L. Gastric nitrite concentrations were minimal (< 1 mumol/l). Gastric headspace gas NO concentration was 16.4+/-5.8 parts per million (ppm). After nitrate ingestion, gastric nitrate peaked at 20 minutes at 3,430+/-832 umol/L, plasma nitrate at 134+/-7.2 umol/L, salivary nitrate at 1516.7+/-280.5 umol/L, and salivary nitrite at 761.5+/-187.7 umol/L after 20-40 minutes. Gastric nitrite concentrations tended to be low, variable, and any rise was non-sustained. Gastric NO concentrations rose considerably from 14.8+/-3.1 ppm to 89.4+/-28.6 ppm (p < 0.0001) after 60 minutes. All parameters remained increased significantly for the duration of the study. CONCLUSIONS: A very large and sustained increase in chemically derived gastric NO concentrations after an oral nitrate load was shown, which may be important both in host defense against swallowed pathogens and in gastric physiology.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for POTASSIUM NITRATE (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']",

The solubility and absorption of lead as lead acetate, lead chloride, lead superoxide, as well as vitrified slagged aggregate were studied. Solubility profiles at pH 1, 3, 5 and 7 differed for each compound. Maximal solubility of the lead salts ranged from 2.89 pH 3, with lead chloride, having intermediate values. In each case, the solubility of lead increased as pH decreased from pH 7 to pH 3. However, as pH was lowered further, solubility of lead decreased. Lead from vitrified slagged aggregate was found to be soluble at a maximal level of 2.3 ppm at pH 3. Mice were administered 10 mg of ground vitrified slagged aggregate by gavage and monitored for blood lead levels at 1, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hr. Peak blood lead levels of 13.8 ppb were found at 8 hr dropping to 3.4 ppb at 24 hr after administration. In other experiments, mice were given drinking water containing from approximately 100-1000 ppm of either lead chloride, lead acetate, or lead superoxide ad libitum for 30 consecutive days. The resulting blood lead levels at the end of this period appear to be a function of the concentration of the lead in the drinking water, as well as of the specific salt, with lead superoxide providing the lowest level of lead. These data further indicate that the lead in vitrified slagged aggregate, which reportedly exists as an oxide, is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following gavage.', 'In 1-week-old suckling rats, an absorption rate of about 52% was reported after a single oral dose of lead chloride, compared to 0.4% in 6-week-old animals.']",,

The less water-soluble the chromate, the higher was its elimination via the feces. Absorbed chromium was retained in the spleen and bone marrow in all three cases, and also in the liver and kidneys in the case of sodium chromate. Chromium levels in blood and urine are not indicative of inhalation exposure to insoluble chromates.', 'Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) equipped with energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX), electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and laser microprobe for mass analysis (LAMMA) were used to follow the fate of chromium compounds deposited in the sheep tracheal lobe. Four chromium compounds were used: two chromium(VI) compounds (lead chromate and chromium trioxide) and two chromium(III) compounds (chronic oxide and chromium sulfate). Chromium trioxide is very soluble and the other three are slightly soluble. The compositions, concentrations, and sizes of particles were determined in the bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) at d 2, 3, 5, and 30 after instillation and on the lung samples collected at d 31. The concentrations of particles in the BAL samples separated the chromium compounds in two groups where Cr2O3 and PbCrO4 (as Pb) were higher than Cr2(SO4)3, PbCrO4 (as Cr), and CrO3. The half-life for alveolar clearance of Cr2O3 and Cr2(SO4)3 has been calculated respectively at 11 and 80 d. Prismatic PbCrO4 particles break up in the lung and sustain a high concentration of isometric particles of lead chromate and another lead-containing compound in the BAL. The CrO3 instilled particles react with endogenous compounds or are transformed to insoluble hydroxyl complexes instead of diffusing very rapidly through the alveolar-capillary barrier. The alveolar clearance as measured in the BAL is not different from the control.']","['Hexavalent chromium compounds are known carcinogens for the respiratory tract in humans. The mechanism of cell transformation by hexavalent chromium compounds is not fully understood although a role for intracellular reduction is sought. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of Cr valence states in human cells after in vitro exposure to soluble or particulate chromium compounds. A synchrotron X-ray-based microprobe was used to investigate the cellular reduction of Cr(VI) and to image chromium oxidation states in cells. It was shown that soluble Cr(VI) compounds are fully reduced to Cr(III) in cells. Cr(III) is homogeneously distributed within the cell volume and therefore present within the nucleus. In the case of low solubility particulate chromate compounds, Cr(VI) can coexist in the cell environment, as particles in the perinuclear region, together with intracellular and intranuclear Cr(III). Chemical distribution maps also suggest that intracellular Cr(III) originates from extracellular dissolution and reduction of lead chromate rather than from intracellular engulfed particles. The possible stronger carcinogenicity of low solubility chromate vs soluble chromate compounds may derive from the combinative genotoxic effects of intranuclear Cr(III) and the persistent exposure to a strong oxidant, Cr(VI). /Soluble and particulate chromates/', 'Exposure to certain particulate hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] compounds, such as lead chromate (PbCrO4), has been associated with lung cancer and respiratory tract toxicity. Previous studies indicate that the solubility of Cr(VI)-compounds is an important factor in Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. The present study investigates reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by PbCrO4 particles and cellular responses using RAW 264.7 cells. A mixture containing PbCrO4 and RAW 264.7 cells generated hydroxyl radical ((.)OH), using cellularly generated H2O2 as a precursor, as measured by electron spin resonance (ESR) spin trapping in combination with H2O2 and (.)OH scavengers, catalase and sodium formate. The effect of ascorbic acid on (.)OH radicals was also measured using ESR. Confocal microscopy showed that particles could become either bound to the cell surface or engulfed over a 120 min time period. H2O2 generation and O2 consumption were also increased after treatment of the cells with PbCrO4. Both NF-kappaB and AP-1 were activated after exposure to PbCrO4 particles as measured by the NF-kappaB or AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid assay. Our investigation thus demonstrated that the RAW 264.7 cells phagocytized the PbCrO4 particles leading to accumulation of the particles within vacuoles in the cytoplasm. These particles could induce chronic production of ROS and activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1. Such induction of transcription pathways may be involved in the inflammatory and carcinogenic responses induced by Cr(VI)-containing particles. /Lead chromate oxide/', 'Free radical reactions are believed to play an important role in the mechanism of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. Most studies concerning the role of free radical reactions have been limited to soluble Cr(VI). Various studies have shown that solubility is an important factor contributing to the carcinogenic potential of Cr(VI) compounds. Here, we report that reduction of insoluble PbCrO4 by glutathione reductase in the presence of NADPH as a cofactor generated hydroxyl radicals (.OH) and caused DNA damage. The .OH radicals were detected by electron spin resonance (ESR) using 5,5-dimethyl-N-oxide as a spin trap. Addition of catalase, a specific H2O2 scavenger, inhibited the .OH radical generation, indicating the involvement of H2O2 in the mechanism of Cr(VI)-induced .OH generation. Catalase reduced .OH radicals measured by electron spin resonance and reduced DNA strand breaks, indicating .OH radicals are involved in the damage measured. The H2O2 formation was measured by change in fluorescence of scopoletin in the presence of horseradish peroxidase. Molecular oxygen was used in the system as measured by oxygen consumption assay. Chelation of PbCrO4 impaired the generation of .OH radical. The results obtained from this study show that reduction of insoluble PbCrO4 by glutathione reductase/NADPH generates .OH radicals. The mechanism of .OH generation involves reduction of molecular oxygen to H2O2, which generates .OH radicals through a Fenton-like reaction. The .OH radicals generated by PbCrO4 caused DNA strand breakage.']",['... The half-life for alveolar clearance of Cr2O3 and Cr2(SO4)3 has been calculated respectively at 11 and 80 d. ...']

The tissues were analyzed for mercury. The amount of each compound transported through the sac and brush border membrane vesicle walls and the amount bound to the tissues were calculated. The data were compared with the stability constants of the compounds.

Mercuric acetate was transported through the intestinal wall to the greatest extent, followed by mercuric chloride, mercuric thiocyanate, mercuric bromide, and mercuric cyanide, in that order. The degree of transport of the compounds correlated inversely with the logarithm of their stability constants. In brush border membrane vesicles, uptake of the compounds also correlated inversely with the logarithm of their stability constants. Increases in pH significantly increased uptake of all compounds except mercuric cyanide. Mercuric acetate, mercuric chloride, mercuric thiocyanate, mercuric bromide, and mercuric-cyanide were incubated with rat brush border membrane vesicles at pH 5.5, 6.4, or 7.4 in hypertonic medium to assess the effects of osmolarity on uptake.

The rate of sulfur trioxide radical formation was demonstrated by use of the spin trapping agent 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyroline-1-oxide (DMPO) with subsequent formation of an adduct. The intensity of adduct formation was most intense in cells with low sulfite oxidase activity, while a mixture of the adduct and of DMPO hydroxyl radical was mainly observed in cells with high sulfite oxidase activity. Furthermore, experiments carried out on purified sulfite oxidase showed that in the presence of sulfite the enzyme could also give rise to a DMPO-OH adduct. Sulfite oxidase activity in cells isolated from healthy young and old donors was positive correlated with both rates of sulfur trioxide radical formation and sulfite oxidation to sulfate, respectively. However, sulfite oxidase activity in cells isolated from centenarians and patients with Down's syndrome seems to lose partly its rate of oxidising sulfite to sulfate. The intensity of the sulfur centered radical adduct increased in the two latter groups of population and the radical observed was predominantly sulfur trioxide radical.""]",

Putative S-oxide metabolites of cysteine S-conjugates were chemically synthesized, and diastereomers were separated and identified by spectroscopic means. The metabolic products of cysteine S-conjugates were identified by comparing the chemical properties of the metabolites with authentic synthetic cysteine S-conjugate S-oxides. S-conjugate S-oxygenase activity was not observed with rat kidney microsomes but was present when cysteine S-conjugates were incubated with the highly purified flavin containing monooxygenase from hog liver. The kinetic parameters indicated that considerable S-oxygenase stereoselectivity and structural selectivity was observed: cis cysteine S-conjugates were preferred substrates and N-acetylation of cysteine S-conjugates decreased substrate activity. S-Oxygenation was considerably diastereoselective and diastereoselectivity was much greater for cysteine S-conjugates with higher Vmax values. Cysteine S-conjugate S-oxides were not indefinitely stable, and under certain conditions, the S-oxides under- went a (2,3)-sigmatropic rearrangement to acrolein. Formation of acrolein or other electrophilic products from S-(chloropropenyl)cysteine conjugate S-oxides may contribute to the renal effects observed for S-(chloropropenyl)cysteine conjugates. Thus, cytotoxicity studies with isolated rat proximal tubular cells or LLC-PK1 cells treated with cysteine S-conjugates showed a time and dose dependent decrease in cell viability. Reduction of renal cytotoxicity of cysteine S-conjugates in the presence of methimazole, an alternate substrate competitive inhibitor of the flavin-containing monooxygenase, suggested that this enzyme may contribute to the renal effects of 1,3-dichloropropene.', 'The biotransformation to sulfur containing products of the Z-isomers & E-isomers of 1,3-dichloropropene administered ip in combination to male Wistar-rats was investigated. The presence of mercapturic acids in the urine of the animals was determined using GC with nitrogen & sulfur selective detection (GC-NDP & GC-FDP, respectively) & GC/MS with negative chemical ionization & single ion detection. Quantification of mercapturic acids in the urine of animals treated with the dichloropropene isomers in doses of 5 ug each, was achieved with the use of GC-NDP & GC-FPD, while GC/negative chemical ionization/MS detected only the mercapturic acids generated by doses = 25 ug or higher, due to the interference of endogenous products.

However, the metabolic effects of another family member, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), are not well characterized. Effects of LIF on skeletal muscle glucose uptake and palmitate oxidation and signaling were investigated in ex vivo incubated mouse soleus and EDL muscles from muscle-specific AMPKalpha2 kinase-dead, muscle-specific SOCS3 knockout, and lean and high-fat-fed mice. Inhibitors were used to investigate involvement of specific signaling pathways. LIF increased muscle glucose uptake in dose (50-5,000 pM/l) and time-dependent manners with maximal effects at the 30-min time point. LIF increased Akt Ser(473) phosphorylation (P) in soleus and EDL, whereas AMPK Thr(172) P was unaffected. Incubation with parthenolide abolished LIF-induced glucose uptake and STAT3 Tyr(705) P, whereas incubation with LY-294002 and wortmannin suppressed both basal and LIF-induced glucose uptake and Akt Ser(473) P, indicating that JAK and PI 3-kinase signaling is required for LIF-stimulated glucose uptake. Incubation with rapamycin and AZD8055 indicated that mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC)2, but not mTORC1, also is required for LIF-stimulated glucose uptake. In contrast to CNTF, LIF stimulation did not alter palmitate oxidation. LIF-stimulated glucose uptake was maintained in EDL from obese insulin-resistant mice, whereas soleus developed LIF resistance. Lack of SOCS3 and AMPKalpha2 did not affect LIF-stimulated glucose uptake. In conclusion, LIF acutely increased muscle glucose uptake by a mechanism potentially involving the PI 3-kinase/mTORC2/Akt pathway and is not impaired in EDL muscle from obese insulin-resistant mice.', 'The aim of the work is to analyze the relationship between consumption of glucose solution by rats and its absorption, and to use this fact for assessment of the absorptive capacity of the small intestine in non anesthetized animals in vivo. Consumption of glucose solution (200 g/L) by fasted rats was recorded in the control, and after administration of phloridzin--inhibitor of glucose active transport- or 3 hours after the restriction stress. On the mathematical model we studied the relative role of factors that can influence the temporal dynamics of glucose consumption by rats. The rate of glucose consumption was observed being decreased in the presence of phloridzin (1 mM), and be increased after the stress. The results of modeling are consistent with the experimental data and show that the rate of consumption of glucose solutions considerably more depends on the transport activity of the small intestine than on glucose concentration in the solution, or on the substrate regulation of the stomach emptying. Analysis of dynamics of consumption of glucose solution by intact rats may be considered as one of promising approaches to assessing the absorptive capacity of the small intestine under natural conditions.', 'Facilitated diffusion involves carrier substance within placenta, which acts to incr rate of transfer beyond that which would be expected... glucose is apparently transferred in this manner. ...No metabolic energy may be required, & transfer is in direction of concn gradient.', 'When excesses are given IV blood sugar values usually return near normal within an hour or two, most of excess having been eliminated through kidneys, & CA 40% dialyzes into tissues with small amt destroyed by oxidation.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for D(+)-Glucose (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['Growth of Escherichia coli on glucose in batch culture is accompanied by the excretion of acetate, which is consumed by the cells when glucose is exhausted. This glucose-acetate transition is classically described as a diauxie (two successive growth stages). Here, we investigated the physiological and metabolic properties of cells after glucose exhaustion through the analysis of growth parameters and gene expression. We found that E. coli cells grown on glucose in batch culture produce acetate and consume it after glucose exhaustion but do not grow on acetate. Acetate is catabolized, but key anabolic genes--such as the genes encoding enzymes of the glyoxylate shunt--are not upregulated, hence preventing growth. Both the induction of the latter anabolic genes and growth were observed only after prolonged exposure to low concentrations of acetate and could be accelerated by high acetate concentrations. We postulate that such decoupling between acetate catabolism and acetate anabolism might be an advantage for the survival of E. coli in the ever-changing environment of the intestine. The glucose-acetate transition is a valuable experimental model for comprehensive investigations of metabolic adaptation and a current paradigm for developing modeling approaches in systems microbiology. Yet, the work reported in our paper demonstrates that the metabolic behavior of Escherichia coli during the glucose-acetate transition is much more complex than what has been reported so far. A decoupling between acetate catabolism and acetate anabolism was observed after glucose exhaustion, which has not been reported previously. This phenomenon could represent a strategy for optimal utilization of carbon resources during colonization and persistence of E. coli in the gut and is also of significant interest for biotechnological applications.', 'When V. cholerae encounters nutritional stress, it activates (p)ppGpp-mediated stringent response. The genes relA and relV are involved in the production of (p)ppGpp, whereas the spoT gene encodes an enzyme that hydrolyzes it. Herein, we show that the bacterial capability to produce (p)ppGpp plays an essential role in glucose metabolism. The V. cholerae mutants defective in (p)ppGpp production (i.e. deltarelAdeltarelV and deltarelAdeltarelVdeltaspoT mutants) lost their viability because of uncontrolled production of organic acids, when grown with extra glucose. In contrast, the deltarelAdeltaspoT mutant, a (p)ppGpp overproducer strain, exhibited better growth in the presence of the same glucose concentration. An RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that transcriptions of genes consisting of an operon for acetoin biosynthesis were markedly elevated in N16961, a seventh pandemic O1 strain, but not in its (p)ppGpp(0) mutant during glucose-stimulated growth. Transposon insertion in acetoin biosynthesis gene cluster resulted in glucose-induced loss of viability of the deltarelAdeltaspoT mutant, further suggesting the crucial role of acetoin production in balanced growth under glucose-rich environments. Additional deletion of the aphA gene, encoding a negative regulator for acetoin production, failed to rescue the (p)ppGpp(0) mutant from the defective glucose-mediated growth, suggesting that (p)ppGpp-mediated acetoin production occurs independent of the presence of AphA. Overall, our results reveal that (p)ppGpp, in addition to its well known role as a stringent response mediator, positively regulates acetoin production that contributes to the successful glucose metabolism and consequently the proliferation of V. cholerae cells under a glucose-rich environment, a condition that may mimic the human intestine.', 'Heterogeneity within the same tumor type has been described to be complex and occur at multiple levels. Less is known about the heterogeneity at the level of metabolism, within a tumor set, yet metabolic pathways are highly relevant to survival signaling in tumors. In this study, we profiled the glucose metabolism of several non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines and could show that, NSCLC display distinct glycolytic metabolism. Genetic and pharmacological perturbation of glycolysis was selectively toxic to NSCLCs with high rates of glycolysis. Furthermore, high expression of hexokinase-2, localized at the mitochondria, was a feature of the NSCLCs dependent on glucose catabolism. Our study provides evidence for quantitative metabolic diversity in NSCLCs and indicates that glucose metabolism provide differential prosurvival benefits to NSCLCs.', 'To observe the influence of different concentrations of bisphenol A (BPA) on glucose metabolism and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) expression in rat Sertoli cells in vitro and investigate the mechanisms of BPA inducing male infertility. Using two-step enzyme digestion, we isolated Sertoli cells from male Wistar rats and constructed a primary Sertoli cell system, followed by immunohistochemical FasL staining. We randomly divided the Sertoli cells into a control group to be cultured in the serum-free minimal essential medium (MEM) plus dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and three experimental groups to be treated with 100 nmol/L, 10 umol/L, and 1 mmol/L BPA, respectively, in the MEM plus DMSO. After 48 hours of treatment, we measured the proliferation of the cells by CCK-8 assay, determined the concentrations of metabolites by NMR spectroscopy, and detected the expression of LDH in the Sertoli cells by RT-PCR and Western blot. The purity of the isolated Sertoli cells was (96.05 +/- 1.28)% (n = 10). Compared with the control group, the 100 nmol/L, 10 umol/L, and 1 mmol/L BPA groups showed no remarkable changes in the proliferation of Sertoli cells ([98 +/- 8]%, [96 +/- 3]%, and [95 +/- 3]%, P >0.05), but the 10 umol/L and 1 mmol/L of BPA groups exhibited significantly decreased concentrations of intracellular glucose ([3.89 +/- 0.07] vs [3.36 +/- 0.24] and [3.04 +/- 0.21] pmol/cell, P <0.05) and lactate ([0.43 +/- 0.06] vs [0.29 +/- 0.05] and [0.20 +/- 0.03] pmol/cell, P <0.05). The expression of LDH mRNA was decreased with the increased concentration of BPA, while that of LDH protein reduced only in the 1 mmol/L BPA group (P <0.05). High-concentration BPA decreases the expression of LDH and alters glucose metabolism in Sertoli cells, and therefore may reduce the provision of lactate for germ cells and impair spermatogenesis.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for D(+)-Glucose (9 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']",

Two types of aluminum binding sites were identified: one insensitive to low temp (2 °C) and one existing only at 22 °C. At 2 °C and 200 uM aluminum, uptake reached approx 1.2 umol aluminum/g fresh wt within 50 min and remained at this level. At 22 °C, aluminum uptake did not reach equilibrium within 150 min and was characterized by a rapid uptake (0.50 umol aluminum/g fresh wt) for less than 20 min, followed by another phase at 0.19 umol Aluminum/g fresh wt/hr. The initial uptake of aluminum increased under conditions which favored leakage of phosphorus from the roots; uptake of aluminum from 50 uM aluminum was about twice as high in high phosphorus plants compared to low phosphorus plants.

A study of six male volunteers exposed at 1 ppm commercial Telone II (50.6% cis-isomer, 45.2% trans-isomer) for 6 hours found the absorption of cis-DCP was 72% to 80%, while the absorption of trans-DCP was 77% to 82%. A similar percent absorption was found in rats exposed at 136 mg/cu m DCP for 3 hours. DCP does not bioaccumulate in the body. Half-lives were similar for both rats and humans for removal from the blood and for excretion of mercapturic acid metabolites. /A study/ found that the concentration of DCP in expired air and concentration in blood plateaued in the first hour of exposure and declined rapidly postexposure to nondetectable levels in less than an hour.

Within 4 days, about 1% of the dose of each isomer was found in the carcass.', '... /Some/ studies have concluded that urine collection during and after exposure may be representative of exposure to dichloropropene (DCP). Urinary excretion of thioethers was measured in 12 applicators occupationally exposed to DCP and was compared to excretion of the mercapturic acid metabolites. The 8-hour time weighted average exposures to the Z-isomer and the E-isomer of DCP ranged from 0.3 to 18.9 mg/cu m over 1- to 11-hour shifts. Cumulative urinary thioether excretions and urinary postshift levels minus preshift levels correlated well with DCP exposures. Mean urinary thioether concentrations were 1.38-fold greater than the mean DCP mercapturic acid metabolite concentration, suggesting the presence of an unidentified thioether metabolite. The thioether assay correlated well with relatively high DCP exposures.', 'Studies conducted on occupational and non-occupational exposure to dichloropropene (DCP) in the Dutch flower bulb culture industry found a strong correlation between inhalation exposure and the complete cumulative urinary excretion of the mercapturic acids of DCP. A possible subclinical nephrotoxic effect of subchronic DCP exposure was noted. There was a notable decrease of glutathione and GST activity in blood, suggesting that DCP exposure may affect the glutathione conjugating capacity.', 'In /a/ personal air monitoring study of 15 applicators of dichloropropene (DCP), excretion of the DCP metabolite, 3CNAC, and excretion of the renal tubular enzyme, NAG [N-acetyl glucosaminidase], were studied. Four workers had clinically elevated NAG in all of their urine collections after baseline. Nine workers showed greater than 25% increases in NAG excretion when compared to baseline. Dichloropropene air exposure products of >700 mg/min/cu m or excretion of >1.5 mg 3CNAC/day distinguished abnormally high daily excretion of NAG. These data indicate a positive relationship between air exposure and internal exposure and a possible subclinical nephrotoxic effect in workers. In a subsequent study using these same urine samples collected during five consecutive 6- to 8-hour intervals and stored frozen for 4 years, /the authors/ analyzed the samples for albumin and retinal binding protein (RBP). Urinary excretion of albumin and RBP during the second through fifth collection intervals was not significantly increased relative to the baseline period after correction for creatinine. Within each interval, excretion of albumin and RBP was significantly correlated with each other and the 3CNAC concentrations. NAG excretion was slightly increased in nine subjects. When the 3CNAC excretion data were dichotomized into subjects excreting less than and more than 1.5 mg/day, which corresponded to low and high DCP exposures, urinary excretion of NAG and RBP was significantly lower in the low exposure than in the high exposure group. Urinary albumin excretion was similar in both groups. Urinary excretion of RBP and albumin during the baseline period correlated best with 24 hours cumulative excretion of these proteins as indicated by logistic regression analysis. Excretion of NAG during the afternoon shift correlated best with 24-hour cumulative NAG excretion. Urinary 3CNAC excretion during the next morning correlated best with its 24-hour cumulative excretion.

Only quantitative differences are seen between the overall metabolic profile of DCP in these two species.', '1,3-Dichloropropene (1,3-DCP) is used as a soil nematocide worldwide. Technical grade 1,3-DCP is genotoxic/mutagenic and carcinogenic. /A previous study/ reported that mutagenic activity is lost after purification of 1,3-DCP samples via silica gel column chromatography. We found that mutagenicity and SOS repair in Escherichia coli, strain PM 21, are strongly reduced after purification via silica gel and that mutagenicity and induction of SOS repair depend on oxidative impurities and secondary products. Both isomers (E and Z) of 1,3-DCP are oxidized to 1,3-dichloropropene epoxide (1,3-DCP-Ox). The epoxide is subjected to rapid internal rearrangement to 2,3-dichloropropanal (2,3-DCPA), which spontaneously eliminates HCl and forms the extremely mutagenic, genotoxic, and carcinogenic 2-chloroacrolein (alpha-chloroacrolein) alpha-ClA. Thus, the genotoxic/mutagenic effects of unpurified 1,3-DCP samples mainly depend on alpha-ClA. The underlying genotoxic and mutagenic mechanism is formation of promutagenic exocyclic 1,N(2)-propanodeoxyguanosine adducts of alpha-ClA. Pure 1,3-DCP samples have only a very low S(N)1 reactivity as measured in trifluoroacetic acid solvolysis reactions, hydrolysis, and computed reactivities but possess a moderate S(N)2 reactivity as determined in alkylation tests with the nucleophiles 4-(p-nitrobenzyl)pyridine (NBP) and N-methyl-mercaptoimidazole (MMI). Evidently, the low S(N)1 reactivity is not sufficient to form necessary amounts of O(6)-alkylguanine DNA adducts required for back-mutation in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA1535. The S(N)2 reactivity may, however, lead to other DNA adducts, e.g., N7-guanine adducts, which can induce error prone repair in S. typhimurium strain TA100 and thus lead to back-mutation in this strain. Application of 1,3-DCP samples in agriculture must be considered as a mutagenic risk because the samples can be oxidized and form the extremely mutagenic alpha-ClA. As a consequence, it is questionable whether any stabilizers can prevent oxidation during application.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for 1,3-DICHLOROPROPENE (12 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['Whole body: 1-2 days; [TDR, p. 518]', 'A urinary excretion half-life of approximately 5.5 hours for DCP in rats and mice was calculated.', 'In rats, the initial elimination half-life for 1,3-dichloropropene in blood ranged from 3 to 27 minutes depending on dose. 1,3-Dichloropropene mercapturic acid metabolites have urinary elimination half-lives of approximately 5 hours.', '(14)C-1,3-dichloropropene ((14)C-DCP) is rapidly absorbed and eliminated in both the male F344 rat and B6C3F1 mouse following oral administration of 1 or 50 mg/kg (rat) or 1 or 100 mg/kg (mouse).

Acid digests of entire male mice that were administered ip 1/6 of the distal LD50, either once or repeatedly at weekly intervals, were analyzed to determine the whole body persistence and clearance kinetics of Cr. Mice dosed once with Cr(III) retained 6.5 times more chromium at 21 days than mice treated with Cr(VI). When Cr(III) was given at weekly intervals mice accumulated 6 times more Cr by 8 wk than Cr(VI)-treated mice, though only the latter showed symptoms of chromic toxicity. Whole body Cr concentrations continued to rise with further Cr(III) treatments, but slowly declined with Cr(VI). Analyses of fecal and urinary excretion confirmed that most of the urinary Cr excretion from Cr(VI)-treated animals was much faster in both urine and feces than from mice given Cr(III). The differential storage and clearance kinetics of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) compounds may be significant in experimental Cr carcinogenesis studies and in the toxicology of Cr in workers exposed industrially to potentially carcinogenic chromium-containing dusts or aerosols.', 'Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) equipped with energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX), electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and laser microprobe for mass analysis (LAMMA) were used to follow the fate of chromium compounds deposited in the sheep tracheal lobe. Four chromium compounds were used: two chromium(VI) compounds (lead chromate and chromium trioxide) and two chromium(III) compounds (chronic oxide and chromium sulfate). Chromium trioxide is very soluble and the other three are slightly soluble. The compositions, concentrations, and sizes of particles were determined in the bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) at d 2, 3, 5, and 30 after instillation and on the lung samples collected at d 31. The concentrations of particles in the BAL samples separated the chromium compounds in two groups where Cr2O3 and PbCrO4 (as Pb) were higher than Cr2(SO4)3, PbCrO4 (as Cr), and CrO3. The half-life for alveolar clearance of Cr2O3 and Cr2(SO4)3 has been calculated respectively at 11 and 80 d. Prismatic PbCrO4 particles break up in the lung and sustain a high concentration of isometric particles of lead chromate and another lead-containing compound in the BAL. The CrO3 instilled particles react with endogenous compounds or are transformed to insoluble hydroxyl complexes instead of diffusing very rapidly through the alveolar-capillary barrier. The alveolar clearance as measured in the BAL is not different from the control.', 'The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the diffusion rate in vitro and the skin absorption rate of trivalent and hexavalent chromium (Cr) from aqueous solution. Excretion of chromium in urine was also measured. The experiment was carried out on 47 Wistar male rats, 4-5 months old. The solutions of chromium sulfate or potassium dichromate contained 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg Cr per milliliter. Exposure time was 4 hrs. It was found that diffusion rate of Cr3+ was seven-time less than of Cr2O7(2-). Absorption rates of both ions through the skin were similar. Excretion rates of chromium in urine were not different in case exposure to both xenobiotics. It can be concluded that diffusion does not play an important role in absorption of chromium through the skin.

Two pools of reserve selenium are present in the body. The first is as selenomethionine, which is not known to have a physiological function separate from that of methionine. The second reserve pool is the selenium found in liver glutathione peroxidase. Ingested selenite, selenate, and selenocysteine are all metabolized directly to selenide, the reduced form of selenium.

Although selenate and selenite were metabolized differently in the bloodstream, and also a part of only selenate was excreted directly into the urine, the selenium-82 taken up by the liver was shown to be metabolized in a manner indistinguishable between selenate and selenite. Selenium-82 of selenite origin but not of selenate origin was suggested to undergo redox reaction in the bloodstream.

Data for risk evaluations needed for occupational medicine are based on animal experiments only. In order to investigate the metabolic behaviour of tellurium in man, tellurium in different forms was administered perorally to healthy male human volunteers. It was given as sodium tellurate, sodium tellurite, metallic colloid and intrinsically bound in cress. For the latter, cress was cultivated with tellurium-containing water in order to provide tellurium for ingestion in a form which is more equivalent to foodstuffs. After the administration the urinary excretion of tellurium was determined. Tellurium concentrations were measured in urine samples by means of graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS). From the cumulative tellurium excretion in the first four days after the administration, a percentage intestinal absorption of 25% + or - 10% for soluble tellurium salts can be calculated. The renal tellurium excretion is faster after administration of hexavalent tellurium than after ingestion of the tetravalent form. This can explain the higher toxicity of the tetravalent tellurium compounds found in animal experiments. The introduction of tellurium to cress lowered the intestinal absorption to approximately 15%.

At 1, 4, and 8 months after the commencement of Cd treatment, seven rats per group were euthanized for pathological examinations to determine the Cd concentrations in the liver and kidneys and metallothionein (MT) in the liver, kidneys, intestinal mucosa, serum, and urine. One week before each period of 1, 4, and 8 months, the remaining seven rats in each group were administered a single dosage of Cd(109), a tracer, to match the amounts of the designated Cd doses (about 1.2 to 2400 ug/kg body wt). They were euthanized 5 days later to determine the distribution of Cd to various tissues. No Cd-related toxic changes were observed. The concentrations of Cd in the liver and kidneys at any time point and MT in the liver, kidney, serum, and urine at 4 and 8 months increased dose-dependently, whereas MT in the intestinal mucosa did not alter markedly at any time point. The distribution rates of Cd to the liver increased dose-dependently (40% at lower doses to 60% at higher doses), whereas those to the kidney decreased dose-dependently (20% at lower doses to 10% at higher doses). The Cd retention rates 5 days after Cd(109) administration (amounts of Cd in various tissues/amounts of Cd administered) ranged from 0.2 to 1.0% at any time point. These results suggest that the distribution of Cd to the liver and kidneys after the oral administration vary depending on the dosage levels of Cd. The difference of the distribution pattern of Cd to the liver and kidney is probably due to the difference in the form of the absorbed Cd, i.e., free ion or Cd-MT complex, although not closely related to the MT in the intestinal mucosa.', 'An increased body retention of Cd in rats orally pretreated with Cd or Zn is explained by induction of hepatic and renal metallothionein. Whether intestinal absorption of Cd increases after such treatments is not clear yet. To approach this problem we measured jejunal transfer rates of Cd(109) in vitro and in vivo in pretreated rats (0.44 mmol Cd/L or 4.6 mmol Zn/L in the drinking water for 10 days) and compared them with those of untreated controls. Isolated jejunal segments were used for in vitro perfusion. In vivo perfusion was performed in anaesthetized rats with blood collected from mesenteric venules substituting corresponding losses by reinfusion of rat blood. Water and glucose transfer did not differ between controls and pretreated rats. At a luminal concentration of 5 umol Cd(109)Cl2/L, Cd and Zn pretreatment significantly increased the transfer rate of Cd(109) in vitro and in vivo similarly. The Cd(109)  transfer rates in controls in the final perfusion intervals (80-120 min) were 0.06 (pmol/cm/min) in vivo and 0.05 in vitro; the corresponding rates in Cd or Zn pretreated rats were significantly higher (P<0.05) and amounted to 0.11 and 0.18 or 0.15 and 0.23, respectively. Mucosal concentrations of Cd(109) measured at the end of the perfusion period tended to be lower in the pretreated animals than in the controls. This suggests that pretreatment with Cd or Zn reduces the amount of Cd(109) bound to the tissue leaving more Cd(109) for the transfer step. As compared to a level of mucosal metallothionein of 8 ug/g wet weight in controls, increased amounts of 67 or 52 ug/g wet weight in the Cd or Zn pretreated rats, respectively, thus did not decrease but increased transfer rates of Cd(109). Therefore, increased small intestinal transfer rates of Cd can contribute to increase the body retention of Cd seen after oral pretreatment with Cd or Zn.', 'ADULT RATS WERE INJECTED INTRAVENOUSLY WITH (109)CADMIUM CHLORIDE AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE ISOTOPE WITHIN THE BRAIN AND NEIGHBORING NERVOUS STRUCTURES WAS SUBSEQUENTLY STUDIED BY AUTORADIOGRAPHY.

Translocation to the shoot was strongly restricted for both metals, though higher cadmium mobility within the plant could be evidenced. A strong relationship between root content and growth inhibition was detected in the roots in response to copper but not to cadmium treatments. Among species P. pinea seemed to be more tolerant to cadmium, whereas F. angustifolia was highly sensitive to both cadmium and copper. X-ray microanalysis of root tip sections showed that copper and cadmium only accumulated in the root tips of F. angustifolia, copper mostly in the cell walls of the cortex layer, cadmium in the inner compartments of the cortex cells.

Cobalt concentration in the maternal blood was increased in proportion to the administered doses. Cobalt crossed the placenta and appeared in the fetal blood and amniotic fluid. Regardless of the administered dose of cobalt sulfate, cobalt concentration in the blood peaked 2 hr after administration.', 'Sheep given a single dose of hydrated cobalt sulfate were killed. ...The livers contained 400-1200 ppm of cobalt. In cattle dying after a massive overdose of hydrated cobalt sulfate livers contained 5-300 ppm, kidneys 30-200 ppm. /Hydrated cobalt sulfate/', 'Following longer-term exposure (8 weeks) to cobalt sulfate in the diet, exposed rats showed a 30-fold increase in the cobalt concentration in the myocardium, a 26-fold increase in the concentration in the soleus muscle, and a 100-fold increase in the concentration in serum compared with nonexposed controls. Long-term oral exposure of rats to cobalt chloride resulted in significantly increased levels of cobalt in the liver, kidney, muscle, brain, and testes of treated rats.', 'Cobalt metabolism and toxicology are summarized. The biological functions of cobalt are updated in the light of recent understanding of cobalt interference with the sensing in almost all animal cells of oxygen deficiency (hypoxia). Cobalt (Co(2+)) stabilizes the transcriptional activator hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and thus mimics hypoxia and stimulates erythropoietin (Epo) production, but probably also by the same mechanism induces a coordinated up-regulation of a number of adaptive responses to hypoxia, many with potential carcinogenic effects. This means on the other hand that cobalt (Co(2+)) also may have beneficial effects under conditions of tissue hypoxia, and possibly can represent an alternative to hypoxic preconditioning. Cobalt is acutely toxic in larger doses, and in mammalian in vitro test systems cobalt ions and cobalt metal are cytotoxic and induce apoptosis and at higher concentrations necrosis with inflammatory response. Cobalt metal and salts are also genotoxic, mainly caused by oxidative DNA damage by reactive oxygen species, perhaps combined with inhibition of DNA repair. Of note, the evidence for carcinogenicity of cobalt metal and cobalt sulfate is considered sufficient in experimental animals, but is as yet considered inadequate in humans. Interestingly, some of the toxic effects of cobalt (Co(2+)) have recently been proposed to be due to putative inhibition of Ca(2+) entry and Ca(2+)-signaling and competition with Ca(2+) for intracellular Ca(2+)-binding proteins. The tissue partitioning of cobalt (Co(2+)) and its time-dependence after administration of a single dose have been studied in man, but mainly in laboratory animals. Cobalt is accumulated primarily in liver, kidney, pancreas, and heart, with the relative content in skeleton and skeletal muscle increasing with time after cobalt administration. In man the renal excretion is initially rapid but decreasing over the first days, followed by a second, slow phase lasting several weeks, and with a significant long-term retention in tissues for several years. In serum cobalt (Co(2+)) binds to albumin, and the concentration of free, ionized Co(2+) is estimated at 5-12% of the total cobalt concentration. In human red cells the membrane transport pathway for cobalt (Co(2+)) uptake appears to be shared with calcium (Ca(2+)), but with the uptake being essentially irreversible as cobalt is effectively bound in the cytosol and is not itself extruded by the Ca-pump. It is tempting to speculate that this could perhaps also be the case in other animal cells. If this were actually the case, the tissue partitioning and biokinetics of cobalt in cells and tissues would be closely related to the uptake of calcium, with cobalt partitioning primarily into tissues with a high calcium turn-over, and with cobalt accumulation and retention in tissues with a slow turn-over of the cells. The occupational cobalt exposure, e.g. in cobalt processing plants and hard-metal industry is well known and has probably been somewhat reduced in more recent years due to improved work place hygiene. Of note, however, adverse reactions to heart and lung have recently been demonstrated following cobalt exposure near or slightly under the current occupational exposure limit. Over the last decades the use of cobalt-chromium hard-metal alloys in orthopedic joint replacements, in particular in metal-on-metal bearings in hip joint arthroplasty, has created an entirely new source of internal cobalt exposure. Corrosion and wear produce soluble metal ions and metal debris in the form of huge numbers of wear particles in nanometric size, with systemic dissemination through lymph and systemic vascular system. This may cause adverse local reactions in peri-prosthetic soft-tissues, and in addition systemic toxicity. Of note, the metal nanoparticles have been demonstrated to be clearly more toxic than larger, micrometer-sized particles, and this has made the concept of nanotoxicology a crucial, new discipline. As another new potential source of cobalt exposure, suspicion has been raised that cobalt salts may be misused by athletes as an attractive alternative to Epo doping for enhancing aerobic performance. The cobalt toxicity in vitro seems to reside mainly with ionized cobalt. It is tempting to speculate that ionized cobalt is also the primary toxic form for systemic toxicity in vivo. Under this assumption, the relevant parameter for risk assessment would be the time-averaged value for systemic cobalt ion exposure that from a theoretical point of view might be obtained by measuring the cobalt content in red cells, since their cobalt uptake reflects uptake only of free ionized cobalt (Co(2+)), and since the uptake during their 120 days life span is practically irreversible. This clearly calls for future clinical studies in exposed individuals with a systematic comparison of concurrent measurements of cobalt concentration in red cells and in serum.']",,

A gamma camera was used to measure lung retention, while lung clearance was assessed by blood and excretion analysis. Physically and chemically uniform Co-57 particles were retained similarly in the lungs, although the retention of CO particles in the 0.3 to 2.7 micron range was greatly dependent on their physicochemical properties. /In dogs/ The primary clearance pathway was dissolution of the inhaled particles. The rate of dissolution was inversely proportional to the diameter of the /cobalt nitrate or oxide/ particle; depending on particle size, particle dissolution half time ranged from 6 to 80 days. After inhalation, most of the Co-57 was identified in the lungs, followed by muscles, bone, and skin. Less than 10 percent of the initial lung burden was present in the lungs of dogs long term, with a biological half life of 400 days. Dogs exposed to CN retained 90 percent of the body burden in the lung as late as 1050 and 1500 days after exposure, while the other dogs retained only 50 to 70 percent of the body burden in the lungs at 350 and 500 days after exposure. The presence of high concentrations of Co-57 in the trachea and upper respiratory tract at the time of death of the animals confirmed the long term retention of cobalt in some tissues.', '... Accumulation was found in the liver (29% of dose, 10% kidneys, and 4.6% in the   intestines) were found following intracardiac injection of cobalt nitrate in rats.', 'Following intravenous injection of cobalt nitrate (with a 57Co tracer) in various species of animals, most of the injected dose was excreted in the urine; about 80% of the given dose was excreted in the urine within 21 days.']","['In experiments on male albino rats after subcutaneous injection of a single toxic dose it was found that cobaltous nitrate (Co(NO3)2  significantly inhibited the hexobarbital-oxidizing enzyme system, Aniline hydroxylase was significantly inhibited by Co(NO3)2.

Cytochrome p450 preferentially oxidized the nitrogen to nitrogen bond of 1,2-disubstituted hydrazines and hydrazides, while monoamine oxidase oxidized the nitrogen to nitrogen bond of all the classes of hydrazine derivatives that were tested. Oxidation of the nitrogen to nitrogen bond led to the formation of stable azo intemediates in the case of 1,2-disubstituted hydrazines and to unstable monoazo (diazene) metabolites in the case of monosubstituted hydrazines and hydrazides. /Substituted hydrazines/', 'The oxidative metabolism of procarbazine, its azo, hydrazone, and two azoxy derivatives, and methylhydrazine by hepatic microsomes from phenobarbital-pretreated rats was investigated to elucidate the pathway of metabolism that resulted in methane formation from procarbazine. When incubated with microsomal reaction mixtures fortified with NADPH, all of the compounds, except the azoxy isomers, were metabolized to yield methane. A lag phase in methane formation was noted for procarbazine, but not for the other compounds. Kinetic and inhibition studies utilizing methimazole and ethylhydrazine precluded methylhydrazine as an intermediate in methane formation from procarbazine. When the azo derivative was oxidatively metabolized in the presence of liver microsomes, no hydrazone tautomer was detected. Upon monitoring the production of the azo and hydrazone metabolites formed during microsomal metabolism of procarbazine, the azo derivative was formed in sufficient quantities to account for the majority of the methane produced. In addition, small amounts of hydrazone were also detected. It was concluded that both the azo and hydrazone metabolites of procarbazine contribute to methane formation from the terminal methyl group of the hydrazine with the azo derivative being the predominant source and the hydrazone derivative being a minor source of methane. Consideration of the chemical and enzymatic pathways of procarbazine oxidation and the implication of a methyl radical intermediate in methane formation are discussed.']",

We tested this experimentally by feeding sheep grass from contaminated soil, compared with uncontaminated grass and with Cd added to the diet. To produce contaminated herbage, Cd nitrate was added to soil in 11 lysimeters sown with perennial ryegrass, with a further 11 lysimeters receiving no Cd to produce uncontaminated herbage. In the Cd-treated lysimeters, soil had increased exchangeable K, Mg, and Ca, leachate had increased K, Mg, Ca, Na, and P, grass had increased Cd and reduced Mg, Na, P, Mn, Fe, Cr, Al, and Ni, and there was some reduction in grass yield compared with untreated lysimeters. Grass from Cd-treated or untreated lysimeters was fed to groups of 12 ewes for 2 days, with Cd intake equated by adding Cd nitrate to the concentrate feed of ewes receiving the uncontaminated grass. The apparent absorption of Cd, Zn, Mo, Cr, and Al was increased for ewes receiving Cd-enriched grass, and apparent absorption of Cu was reduced, compared to those receiving supplementary inorganic Cd. Most of the unabsorbed Cd was excreted in feces within 4 days of feeding. The ewes consuming Cd in grass had increased B concentrations in their urine, possibly due to adverse effects of Cd on kidney function. Finally, the ewes were offered a choice of the two herbages and they ate significantly more of the uncontaminated grass. It is concluded that the apparent absorption of Cd and other heavy metals by sheep in a short-term experiment was greater when Cd was in the grass than when the Cd was added in in an inorganic form and that sheep partially avoided herbage with a high Cd concentration.']",,

It is thought to mediate its analgesic effect through inhibition of COX-2 enzyme, which is an induced enzyme responsible for inflammatory responses and pain in muscle and joint disorders. By inhibiting fatty acid COX enzyme, trolamine salicylate inhibits the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes in inflammatory cells involved in generating pain and inflammation. It thereby works to temporarily reduce mild to moderate pain. In subjects with muscle soreness from exercise, administration of topical trolamine salicylate was associated with reduced duration and severity of muscule soreness compared to placebo. In subjects with osteoarthritis in hands, trolamine salicylate cream was shown to be effective in achieving temporary relief of minor pain and stiffness.']",,"['Following topical administration of 10% trolamine salicylate in healthy volunteers, salicylic acid could not be detected in serum indicating low systemic absorption.', 'Following topical administration of 10% trolamine salicylate in healthy volunteers, urinary recovery of total salicylate during the first 24 hours was 6.9 mg (p < 0.05), which is 1.4% of total dose.', 'Topical administration of 1 gram of 10% trolamine salicylate in abdominal rat skin resulted in an approximate extravascular volume of distribution (V/F) of 24.0 mL.']",,

Intratracheal instillation of sodium dichromate (CrVI) and chromium acetate hydroxide (CrIII) to male Wistar rats gave rise to increased chromium concentrations in whole blood, plasma and urine up to 72 hr post exposure; peak concentrations were reached at 6 hr after exposure. 2. The ratio of whole blood chromium to plasma chromium concentrations was significantly different for Cr(VI) and Cr(III) treatments. Both blood chromium and plasma chromium assays should therefore be used for the assessment of chromium exposure. 3. Chromium was also detected in peripheral lymphocytes. Cr(VI), but not Cr(III) accumulated significantly in the lymphocytes after treatment. These cells have potential to be used for biomarkers of the assessment of exposure to chromium compounds.']","['In order to understand the possible role of reactive intermediates in the formation of tissue-specific DNA damage by chromium(VI), electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to study the in vivo formation of chromium(V) in the liver and red blood cells of 14 day chick embryos following treatment with chromium(VI). In vivo administration of sodium dichromate onto the inner shell membrane of 14 day chick embryos resulted in the formation of a persistent chromium(V) species in liver cells (g = 1.987). The intensity of the chromium(V) signal in liver cells plateaued at 70 min and persisted for 240 min after treatment with chromium(VI). The dependence of chromium(V) formation on the dose of sodium dichromate administered to the embryo was clearly different in liver versus red blood cells. Chromium(V) was detected in red blood cells only at high doses of sodium dichromate (0.50-0.60 mmol/kg), whereas chromium(V) was undetectable in red blood cells at lower doses of sodium dichromate (0.10-0.30 mmol/kg) which produced clear evidence for chromium(V) in liver. Uptake studies showed that total chromium levels in red blood cells were 10-fold greater than in liver cells, and that up to 10% of the total chromium existed as chromium(V) in liver and red blood cells in vivo. Depletion of glutathione by pretreatment of embryos with L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO) for 24 hr prior to treatment with a high dose of sodium dichromate (0.60 mmol/kg) caused both a decrease in the levels of chromium(V) species produced and a decrease of chromium uptake into red blood cells 50 min after treatment. At this high dose of chromium(VI), BSO pre-treatment had no effect on the level of the chromium(V) or on chromium uptake into liver cells after a 70 min incubation period. Thus, the concentration of chromium(V) inside the cell correlated with the levels of chromium taken up into the cell. Chromium(V) may be the form of chromium which is responsible for induction of DNA damage following in vivo administration of sodium dichromate.']",

This reflects the decreasing retention of fluoride (primarily in bone) with increasing age. Under certain conditions perspiration may be an important route of fluoride excretion. The concentration of fluoride retained in bones and teeth is a function of both the concentration of fluoride intake and the duration of exposure. Periods of excessive fluoride exposure will result in increased retention in the bone.

This approach is based on the findings that N-nitroamino acids (e.g., nitrosoproline (NPRO), nitrosohydroxyproline(NHPRO) and nitrososarcosine (NSAR)) when administered orally to rats, are excreted unchanged almost quantitatively (88-96% of the dose) in the urine and feces. After sequential administration of a nitrosatable amino acid and sodium nitrite, the nitrosamino acid excreted in the urine and feces was analyzed. The amount of nitrosoproline excreted in the urine of rats was proportional to the dose of proline and to the square of the nitrite dose. Co-administration of ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol together with the precursors decreased the urinary nitrosoproline whereas thiocyanate increased the yield. After feeding an amino acid precursor and nitrite, the yield of nitrosamino acids, formed in vivo and excreted in the urine increased in the order: nitrosoproline < nitrososarcosine < nitrosohydroxyproline. The same order was seen when the nitrosation rates of the amino acids in vitro were compared. Evidently, N-nitrosation in vivo in rats occurs via a similar mechanism as observed in vitro. Monitoring of N-nitrosamino acids excreted in the urine and feces appears to provide a valuable index for endogenous N-nitrosation. ...']",
