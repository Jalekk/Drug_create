The drug in tissues was extracted with ethyl acetate, and borneol's concentration detected by GC, with octadecane as the internal standard. The calibration curve showed a good linear relationship. Extraction recoveries, inter-day and intra-day precisions and stability were in conformity with the analytical requirements of biological samples. Borneol was mainly distributed in most tissues, more in heart, brain and kidney, and less in liver, spleen and lung. The established GC-FID method is applicable for content determination of borneol in tissues. After intravenous and intranasal administrations in mice, borneol is mainly distributed in abundant blood-supply tissues. After intranasal administration, brain tissues showed the highest target coefficient and target effectiveness."", '... In order to understand the blood and brain pharmacokinetics after intravenous, intranasal, or oral administration and to investigate the superiority and feasibility of intranasal administration, a simple gas chromatographic (GC) method with flame ionization detection (FID) was developed for the quantification of borneol. Blood samples and brain were collected from mice at 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after intravenous, intranasal, or oral administration of borneol at a dosage of 30.0 mg/kg. Sample preparations were carried out by liquid-liquid extraction with an internal standard solution of octadecane. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated /using computer software/. The calibration curves were linear in the range of 0.11-84.24 ug/mL and 0.16-63.18 ug/g for borneol in plasma and brain, respectively. The methodological and extraction recoveries were both in the range of 85%-115%. The intra-day and inter-day variabilities for plasma and brain samples were </= 5.00% relative standard deviation (RSD). The absolute bioavailabilities F of intranasal and oral administrations were 90.68% and 42.99%. The relative brain targeted coefficients Re of intranasal and oral administrations were 68.37% and 38.40%. The GC-FID method developed could be applied to determination and pharmacokinetic study. The borneol from injection was distributed and metabolized fast without absorption process. The borneol from oral administration was distributed more slowly and had the lowest absolute bioavailability. Nasal administration of borneol was quickly absorbed into the blood and brain, was easy to use and had a greater safety than infection, which makes it worthy of further development as an administration route for encephalopathy treatment.', 'The aim of this work was to study the in situ and in vivo nasal absorption of borneol. A novel single pass in situ nasal perfusion technique was applied to examine the rate and extent of nasal absorption of borneol by rats. Experimental conditions, such as perfusion rate, pH and drug concentration, were investigated. The in situ experiments showed that the nasal absorption of borneol was not dependent on drug concentration, and fitted a first order process. The absorption rate constant, Ka, influenced with an increase in perfusion speed. The borneol was well absorbed in the conditions of the nasal cavity within the pH range and pH value of physiological conditions. In vivo studies of borneol absorption were carried out in rats and the pharmacokinetics parameters of intranasal (in) was compared with intravenous (iv) administration. The bioavailabilities of borneol was 90.82% for i.n. while Tmax values were 10 min. MRT (Mean Residence Time) were 262.55 +/- 67.35 min and 204.22 +/- 14.50 min for in and iv methods, respectively. The results demonstrate that borneol could be absorbed promptly and thoroughly by in administration in rats.', ""Previous studies have indicated that borneol has double side effects on the central nervous system (CNS), but the mechanism is unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between excitation ratio [contents of excitatory amino acids (AAs) versus that of inhibitory] and the content of natural borneol after a single oral dose. Mice were administered a 1.2 g/kg dose of natural borneol (containing 98% D: -borneol) by oral ingestion. Brain samples were collected before administration and at 0.083, 0.167, 0.25, 0.333, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 hr after administration. The brain concentration of natural borneol and contents of AA neurotransmitters in mice brain were determined by GC-MS and HPLC-FLU, respectively. After per oral application, natural borneol was absorbed rapidly into the brain and could be determined 5 min after dosing. The maximal brain concentration (86.52 ug/g) was reached after 1 hr post-dosing. Natural borneol could affect the contents of AA neurotransmitters in mice brain: L: -aspartic acid increased significantly from 0.083 to 1 hr after administration, L: -glutamic acid increased significantly at 0.333 hr and decreased from 1.5 to 5 hr, gamma-amino-N-butyric acid increased significantly from 0.167 to 5 hr, whereas glycine was not affected. The excitation ratio is the contents of excitatory AAs versus that of inhibitory AAs, which reflects the excitatory or inhibitory state of the body. The excitation ratio elevated transitorily and then declined 0.5 hr post-dosing; there were significant differences between 1.5-5 hr post-dose compared with pre-dose. The present study indicated that natural borneol could affect the contents of AA neurotransmitters, and the change in excitatory ratio led to borneol's double side effects on the CNS."", 'The percutaneous absorptions of camphene, isoborneol-acetate, limonene, menthol and alpha-pinene as constituents of a foam bath (Pinimenthol) were measured on animals using radioactively labeled ingredients. Pharmacokinetic measurements showed maximum blood levels for all tested ingredients 10 min after the onset of percutaneous absorption. None of the ingredients was preferentially absorbed. Blood levels of all ingredients after 10 min of percutaneous absorption were a direct function of the size of the skin area involved.']",,

The aim of this study was to investigate the respective part of each of these two organs in the metabolism of the analgesic d-propoxyphene. Pharmacological doses of d-propoxyphene were given in the duodenum (ID), the portal vein (IP), and the femoral vein (IV) of male Wistar rats. A tracer dose of (14)C-d-propoxyphene was also administered either in IV, IP, or ID as well as in hepatectomized rats or rats with bile duct diversion. In vitro demethylation occurring in liver and intestinal microsomes was also studied. Absolute DP bioavailability obtained after oral administration was two times higher than that observed after portal administration (48.9% vs. 23.2%, respectively), an result opposite (i.e. a lower bioavailability) of that expected on the basis of the existence of a liver enzyme saturation phenomenon. The (14)C-d-propoxyphene cumulative excretion after (14)C-d-propoxyphene administration was significantly lower after IV or ID administration than after injection in the portal vein as a bolus or within 20 min. The biliary excretion of the labeled compound varied in the opposite direction, being greater after IV or ID than after IP administration, suggesting that the metabolism of d-propoxyphene in the liver is influenced by an extrahepatic transformation. This most likely occurs in the gut since the production of (14)C-d-propoxyphene after IV administration was similar to that after ID administration. This transformation did not prohibit d-propoxyphene detection in the systemic blood but was sufficient to increase the part eliminated with bile and to decrease the part demethylated NP. Demethylation mainly occurs in the liver since the production of (14)C-d-propoxyphene was nearly abolished in hepatectomized rats. Furthermore, microsomes of hepatic but not of intestinal origin were able to demethylate d-propoxyphene.

The plasma samples were clarified through solid phase extraction prior to simultaneous determination of the anthraquinones with a validated high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence system. The results indicated that the Cmax, t(1/2) and AUC(0-t), of aloe-emodin, rhein, emodin and chrysophanol in TFCI-induced rats were nearly double, whereas the CL values were remarkably decreased (p < 0.05) over those of the normal rats. The plasma drug concentration-time data of five anthraquinones to rats fitted a two-compartment open model. The five anthraquinones in rat plasma were absorbed quickly and eliminated slowly in both groups. The obtained results could be helpful for evaluating the impact of the efficacy and safety of the drug in clinical applications.', 'ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Quyu Qingre granules (QYQRGs) are useful traditional Chinese composite prescription in the treatment of blood stasis syndrome. Comparing differences of pharmacokinetic properties of compounds in QYQRG between normal and blood stasis syndrome rabbits can provide much helpful information. The primary objective of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of rhein and chrysophanol after orally administering 2.0 g/kg b.w. QYQRG in normal and acute blood stasis model rabbits.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: The blood samples were collected subsequently at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 240, 360 and 480 min after orally administrating QYQRG. The concentrations of rhein and chrysophanol in rabbit plasma were determined by HPLC and main pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained.  RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic parameters AUC(0-infinity), T(lag), Cmax and K21 of both rhein and chrysophanol were markedly different in the acute blood stasis model rabbits. It was also found that parameters A, beta, MRT and T(1/2beta) of rhein and the parameters a and T1/2a of chrysophanol all exhibited significant difference between the normal and acute blood stasis model rabbits.  CONCLUSIONS: The absorption time of rhein and chrysophanol was accelerated and the absorption amount of these two compounds was increased in rabbits with acute blood stasis, suggesting that rhein and chrysophanol would possibly be the two effective compounds in QYQRG.', 'AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study comparatively investigated the tissue distributions of rhubarb anthraquinone derivatives (AQs) to examine whether they undergo different uptakes in normal or CCl(4)-induced liver-damaged rats, to explore possible reasons for the different toxicities of AQs in pathological model rats and normal rats at the tissue distribution level.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: The total rhubarb extract (14.49 g/kg of body weight per day based on the quantity of crude material) was administrated orally to normal and model rats for 12 weeks. The concentrations of free AQs in tissues were quantitated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). After drug withdrawal for 4 weeks, tissue distributions were again determined.  RESULTS: The five free AQs-aloe-emodin, rhein, emodin, chrysophanol and physcion-were detected in the liver, kidney and spleen, while only rhein, aloe-emodin and emodin reached the quantitative limit. The tissue distributions of rhein (p < 0.001), aloe-emodin (p < 0.001) and emodin (p < 0.05) in normal rats were higher than those in model rats with rhein>aloe-emodin>emodin in kidney and spleen tissues and aloe-emodin > rhein > emodin in liver tissues. Free AQs were not detected in the tissues after drug withdrawal for 4 weeks.  CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the tissue toxicity of AQs in normal animals is higher than that in pathological model animals with little accumulative toxicity of rhubarb. The results are concordant with the traditional Chinese theory of You Gu Wu Yun recorded first in Su Wen, a classical Chinese medical treatise.']","['The studies presented here were designed to elucidate the enzymes involved in the biotransformation of naturally occurring 1, 8-dihydroxyanthraquinones and to investigate whether biotransformation of 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinones may represent a bioactivation pathway. We first studied the metabolism of emodin (1, 3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone), a compound present in pharmaceutical preparations. With rat liver microsomes, the formation of two emodin metabolites, omega-hydroxyemodin and 2-hydroxyemodin, was observed. The rates of formation of omega-hydroxyemodin were not different with microsomes from rats that had been pretreated with inducers for different cytochrome P450 enzymes. Thus, the formation of omega-hydroxyemodin seems to be catalyzed by several cytochrome P450 enzymes at low rates. The formation of 2-hydroxyemodin was increased in liver microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-pretreated rats and was inhibited by alpha-naphthoflavone, by an anti-rat cytochrome P450 1A1/2 antibody, and, to a lesser degree, by an anti-rat cytochrome P450 1A1 antibody. These data suggest the involvement of cytochrome P450 1A2 in the formation of this metabolite. However, other cytochrome P450 enzymes also seem to catalyze this reaction. The anthraquinone chrysophanol (1,8-dihydroxy-3-methylanthraquinone) is transformed, in a cytochrome P450-dependent oxidation, to aloe-emodin (1, 8-dihydroxy-3-hydroxymethylanthraquinone) as the major product formed. The mutagenicity of the parent dihydroxyanthraquinones and their metabolites was compared in the in vitro micronucleus test in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells. 2-Hydroxyemodin induced much higher micronucleus frequencies, compared with emodin. omega-Hydroxyemodin induced lower micronucleus frequencies, compared with emodin. Aloe-emodin induced significantly higher micronucleus frequencies than did chrysophanol. These data indicate that the cytochrome P450-dependent biotransformation of emodin and chrysophanol may represent bioactivation pathways for these compounds.', 'Chrysophanol, a major anthraquinone component occurring in many traditional Chinese herbs, is accepted as important active component with various pharmacological actions such as antibacterial and anticancer activity. Previous studies demonstrated that exposure to chrysophanol induced cytotoxicity, but the mechanisms of the toxic effects remain unknown. In the present metabolism study, three oxidative metabolites (M1-M3, aloe-emodine, 7-hydroxychrysophanol, and 2-hydroxychrysophanol) and five GSH conjugates (M4-M8) were detected in rat and human liver microsomal incubations of chrysophanol supplemented with GSH, and the formation of the metabolites was NADPH dependent except M4 and M5. M4 and M5 were directly derived from parent compound chrysophanol, M6 arose from M2, and M7 and M8 resulted from the oxidation of M4 and M5. Metabolites M5 and M6 were also observed in bile of rats after exposure to chrysophanol, M1-M3 and one NAC conjugate (M9) were detected in urine of rats administrated chrysophanol, and urinary metabolite M9 originated from the degradation of biliary GSH conjugation M6. Recombinant P450 enzyme incubation and microsome inhibition studies demonstrated that P450 1A2 was the primary enzyme responsible for the metabolic activation of chrysophanol and that P450 2B6 and P450 3A4 also participated in the generation of the oxidative metabolites. ...']",

Libanotis buchtormensis supercritical extract (LBSE) has analgesic, sedative and anti-inflammatory qualities. Osthole is one of the major bioactive components of LBSE; it is known for its significant anti-tumor, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties, it also alleviates hyperglycemia.  AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of the present study was to compare the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of osthole in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats after oral administration of pure osthole and LBSE. The two preparations were administered at the same osthole dose (approximately 130 mg/kg). The results should provide some guidance for the clinical applications of Libanotis buchtormensis.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparative pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of osthole in SD rats after oral administration of pure osthole and LBSE were analyzed using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). All pharmacokinetic data were analyzed using 3P97 software. Samples of blood and internal organs (heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidney) were collected and pretreated according to the experimental schedule. After pretreatment, plasma and tissue samples were extracted using ether-ethyl acetate mixture (3:1, v/v). The concentration of osthole in the plasma and tissues were determined using the RP-HPLC method.  RESULTS: The procedure described in this paper shows good precision and stability and is suitable for the osthole assays in biological samples. We found that the average plasma concentration-time profile of osthole after oral administration of osthole and LBSE showed a single peak. There were also clear differences between plasma concentrations of osthole after oral administration of pure osthole and LBSE. Non-osthole ingredients in LBSE showed some pharmacokinetic interactions with osthole and hence decreased its absorption levels (p<0.05). Our results show different tissue distribution of osthole in the single and composite administration regimens.  CONCLUSIONS: This study compares the pharmacokinetic characteristics and tissue distribution of osthole in rats after oral administration of pure osthole and LBSE; the results might be useful in clinical application of this traditional Chinese herbal medicine.', ""ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Bushen Yizhi prescription (BSYZ) is a traditional Chinese compound prescription, which is commonly used in China for treating ShenXu and hypophrenia based on traditional Chinese medicine and Alzheimer's Disease according to modern Chinese medicine. Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cusson fruits (CM) is treated as the main herb of BSYZ, and its main active ingredient Osthole (OST) is considered as one of the major active ingredients of BSYZ. Even though OST plays an important role in the BSYZ its bioavailability is poor. In order to investigate whether the bioavailability of OST was influenced by BSYZ and CM extract, the comparative evaluations on pharmacokinetics of OST after oral administration of pure OST at different doses, CM and BSYZ extract were studied.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: 30 rats were randomly assigned to five groups and orally administered with pure OST at different doses (15, 75 and 150 mg/kg), CM (15 mg/kg OST) and BSYZ (15 mg/kg OST) extract. At different predetermined time points after administration, the concentrations of OST in rat plasma were determined by using the HPLC-UV method, and main pharmacokinetic parameters were investigated.  RESULTS: The results showed that the pharmacokinetic parameters of OST were significantly different (p<0.05) among the groups. The AUC(0 to t), AUC(0 to infinity) and Cmax of OST were significantly increased after oral administration of BSYZ extract, followed by CM extract, in comparison to pure osthole at different doses.  CONCLUSIONS: This present study indicated that the bioavailability of pure OST after oral administration was extremely low and it was dramatically enhanced because of the synergistic effect of the traditional Chinese Bushen Yizhi prescription."", 'A simple high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed to study the pharmacokinetics of osthole in rat plasma. After addition of an internal standard (paeonol), plasma was deproteinized by acetonitrile for sample clean-up. The drugs were separated on a reversed-phase column and detected by UV absorption at 323 nm. Acetonitrile-water-diethylamine (50:50:0.1, v/v/v) (pH 3.0, adjusted with orthophosphoric acid) was used as the mobile phase. It was applied to the pharmacokinetic study of osthole in rats after a dose of 10 mg/kg by intravenous administration. A biphasic phenomenon with a rapid distribution followed by a slower elimination phase was observed from the plasma concentration-time curve.']","['Osthole is an active ingredient and one of the major coumarin compounds that were identified in the genus Cnidium moonnieri (L.) Cussion, the fruit of which was used as traditional Chinese medicine to treat male impotence, ringworm infection and blood stasis conventionally. Recent studies revealed that osthole has diverse pharmacological effects, such as improving male sexual dysfunction, anti-diabetes, and anti-hypertentions. The inhibition of thrombosis and platelet aggregation and protection of central nerve were also observed. On the other hand, the metabolism of osthole has not yet been investigated thoroughly. Herein the biotransformation of osthole in rat was investigated after oral administration of osthole by using efficient and sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS). Eighteen osthole metabolites and the parent drug were detected and identified in rat urine. Fourteen metabolites of osthole were identified and characterized for the first time. Structures of metabolites of osthole were elucidated by comparing fragment pattern under MS/MS scan and change of molecular weight with those of osthole. The main phase I metabolic pathways were summed as 7-demethylation, 8-dehydrogenation, hydroxylation on coumarin and 3,4-epoxide. Sulfate conjugates were detected as phase II metabolites of osthole.', ""The biotransformation of osthole (1) by Alternaria longipes was carried out, and five transformed products were obtained in the present research work. Based on their extensive spectral data, the structures of these metabolites were characterized as 4'-hydroxyl-osthole (2), 4'-hydroxyl-2',3'-dihydroosthole (3), 2',3'-dihydroxylosthole (4), osthole-4'-oic acid methyl ester (5), and osthole-4'-oic acid glucuron-1-yl ester (6), respectively.

The purpose of the study was to investigate the mechanism and significance of demethylation of MDP and similar compounds in relation to the metabolism and mode of action of commercial synergist chemicals such as piperonyl-butoxide and tropital. Male Swiss-Webster-mice, Sprague-Dawley-rats, or hamsters were administered 13 carbon-14 labeled MDP compounds such as tropital, piperonal, piperonyl-alcohol, piperonylic-acid, safrole, dihydrosafrole, or piperonyl-butoxide. Urine, feces, and expired air were collected for 48 hours for carbon-14 assay. Carbon-14 activity in the intestine, liver, and carcass was determined. Urine samples were analyzed for metabolites. Compounds such as dihydrosafrole, safrole, myristicin, and piperonyl-butoxide were largely metabolized by oxidation of the methylene group of the MDP moiety to yield radiolabeled carbon-dioxide. The radiolabel ultimately appearing as carbon-dioxide was first liberated as radioactive formate. Carbon-dioxide was not an important route of elimination in the metabolism of piperonyl-alcohol, piperonal, piperonylic-acid, and tropital. Their metabolites were excreted primarily in the urine. No marked species difference was noted in carbon-14 tissue distribution after dosing with tropital and piperonyl-butoxide. Oxidation or conjugation of the side chain was the major metabolic pathway for tropital, piperonal, piperonyl-alcohol, and piperonylic-acid. Urinary metabolites of piperonyl-butoxide included many compounds lacking the MDP moiety and small amounts of 6-propyl-piperonylic-acid and its glycine conjugate. Urinary metabolites of tropital included glycine and glucuronic-acid conjugates of piperonylic-acid. In an in-vitro experiment, radiolabeled piperonyl-butoxide, tropital, safrole, and other MDP compounds were incubated with mouse liver microsomes and were assayed for metabolites. Metabolites such as formate and catechols were detected. The authors conclude that demethylation of the MDP moiety is the major metabolic pathway in mammals given piperonyl-butoxide, safrole, dihydrosafrole and myristicin.', 'After oral administration of piperine (170 mg/kg) to rats, the metabolites in bile and urine were examined by thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography and combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

The uptake of GHB or l-lactate by MDA-MB231 cells was pH-dependent but not sodium-dependent.

Small interfering RNA treatment to silence MCT2 or MCT4 significantly decreased their protein expression and the uptake of l-lactate and GHB; however, the decrease in GHB uptake with MCT2 inhibition was smaller than that for MCT4.

The signs of toxicity and effect of equitoxic LD50 doses of saturated and unsaturated aliphatic mono- and dinitriles on tissue and blood CN levels, tissue glutathione levels and cytochrome c oxidase activities were studied in rats. Signs of toxicity were classified into cholinomimetic effects observed with unsaturated nitriles and CNS effects observed with saturated potassium cyanide. Hepatic and blood CN levels 1 hr after treatment were highest following malononitrile and decreased in the order of propionitrile > potassium cyanide > butyronitrile > acrylonitrile > allylcyanide > fumaronitrile > acetonitrile. The order differed in brain where potassium cyanide preceded malononitrile and PCN. Hepatic and cytochrome c oxidase were significantly inhibited and corresponded to their CN levels. No significant inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase was observed in vitro. Acrylonitrile was the only nitrile which significantly reduced tissue GSH levels. Toxic expression of aliphatic nitriles depended on CN release and their degree of unsaturation. With unsaturated aliphatic nitriles CN release played a minimal role in their toxicity. /Cyanides/', 'Acute toxicity and metabolism of 7 dinitriles in mice was studied in relation to the chemical structures. The oral LD50 for each nitrile was detected under different conditions for mice pretreated with either carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or olive oil. All test nitriles were metabolized into cyanide in vivo and in vitro. The cyanide level was variable among the compounds (0.35-0.74 ug cyanide/g brain) at death in the brains of mice, the level from malononitrile and adiponitrile being comparable to that found in mice killed by dosing with potassium cyanide. After receiving each nitrile, the mean survival time of mice pretreated with CCl4 was prolonged and their brain cyanide level decreased when compared with the corresponding control. With malononitrile, the former did not significantly change and the latter decreased slightly. Brain cyanide levels of control mice at death showed a peak at the lower log P region, whereas those of CCl4 pretreated animals remained lower independently of log P, with the exception of malononitrile. Microsomal metabolism of nitriles to cyanide was greatly inhibited when microsomes were prepared from livers of mice pretreated with CCl4. The relationship between log (1/LD50-CCl4), LD50 in mice pretreated with CCl4, and log P fits a parabolic plot. /Cyanides/']",['Half-life for the conversion of cyanide to thiocyanate from a non-lethal dose in man is between 20 min and 1 hr. /Cyanide/']

Borneol was mainly distributed in most tissues, more in heart, brain and kidney, and less in liver, spleen and lung. The established GC-FID method is applicable for content determination of borneol in tissues. After intravenous and intranasal administrations in mice, borneol is mainly distributed in abundant blood-supply tissues. After intranasal administration, brain tissues showed the highest target coefficient and target effectiveness."", '... In order to understand the blood and brain pharmacokinetics after intravenous, intranasal, or oral administration and to investigate the superiority and feasibility of intranasal administration, a simple gas chromatographic (GC) method with flame ionization detection (FID) was developed for the quantification of borneol. Blood samples and brain were collected from mice at 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after intravenous, intranasal, or oral administration of borneol at a dosage of 30.0 mg/kg. Sample preparations were carried out by liquid-liquid extraction with an internal standard solution of octadecane. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated /using computer software/. The calibration curves were linear in the range of 0.11-84.24 ug/mL and 0.16-63.18 ug/g for borneol in plasma and brain, respectively. The methodological and extraction recoveries were both in the range of 85%-115%. The intra-day and inter-day variabilities for plasma and brain samples were </= 5.00% relative standard deviation (RSD). The absolute bioavailabilities F of intranasal and oral administrations were 90.68% and 42.99%. The relative brain targeted coefficients Re of intranasal and oral administrations were 68.37% and 38.40%. The GC-FID method developed could be applied to determination and pharmacokinetic study. The borneol from injection was distributed and metabolized fast without absorption process. The borneol from oral administration was distributed more slowly and had the lowest absolute bioavailability. Nasal administration of borneol was quickly absorbed into the blood and brain, was easy to use and had a greater safety than infection, which makes it worthy of further development as an administration route for encephalopathy treatment.', 'The aim of this work was to study the in situ and in vivo nasal absorption of borneol. A novel single pass in situ nasal perfusion technique was applied to examine the rate and extent of nasal absorption of borneol by rats. Experimental conditions, such as perfusion rate, pH and drug concentration, were investigated. The in situ experiments showed that the nasal absorption of borneol was not dependent on drug concentration, and fitted a first order process. The absorption rate constant, Ka, influenced with an increase in perfusion speed. The borneol was well absorbed in the conditions of the nasal cavity within the pH range and pH value of physiological conditions. In vivo studies of borneol absorption were carried out in rats and the pharmacokinetics parameters of intranasal (in) was compared with intravenous (iv) administration. The bioavailabilities of borneol was 90.82% for i.n. while Tmax values were 10 min. MRT (Mean Residence Time) were 262.55 +/- 67.35 min and 204.22 +/- 14.50 min for in and iv methods, respectively. The results demonstrate that borneol could be absorbed promptly and thoroughly by in administration in rats.', ""Previous studies have indicated that borneol has double side effects on the central nervous system (CNS), but the mechanism is unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between excitation ratio [contents of excitatory amino acids (AAs) versus that of inhibitory] and the content of natural borneol after a single oral dose. Mice were administered a 1.2 g/kg dose of natural borneol (containing 98% D: -borneol) by oral ingestion. Brain samples were collected before administration and at 0.083, 0.167, 0.25, 0.333, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 hr after administration. The brain concentration of natural borneol and contents of AA neurotransmitters in mice brain were determined by GC-MS and HPLC-FLU, respectively. After per oral application, natural borneol was absorbed rapidly into the brain and could be determined 5 min after dosing. The maximal brain concentration (86.52 ug/g) was reached after 1 hr post-dosing. Natural borneol could affect the contents of AA neurotransmitters in mice brain: L: -aspartic acid increased significantly from 0.083 to 1 hr after administration, L: -glutamic acid increased significantly at 0.333 hr and decreased from 1.5 to 5 hr, gamma-amino-N-butyric acid increased significantly from 0.167 to 5 hr, whereas glycine was not affected. The excitation ratio is the contents of excitatory AAs versus that of inhibitory AAs, which reflects the excitatory or inhibitory state of the body. The excitation ratio elevated transitorily and then declined 0.5 hr post-dosing; there were significant differences between 1.5-5 hr post-dose compared with pre-dose. The present study indicated that natural borneol could affect the contents of AA neurotransmitters, and the change in excitatory ratio led to borneol's double side effects on the CNS.""]",,

Similar high efficiencies were seen for iron complexed to specific physiologic and nonphysiologic coordinators, including histidine, citrate, fructose, oxalate and glutamate, and tricine. Because of lower plasma flow rates, single-pass extraction of these iron complexes in vivo should be even greater. Autoradiography confirmed that most iron had been removed by parenchymal cells. Hepatic removal from Krebs-tricine buffer was saturable with similar kinetic parameters for ferrous and ferric iron (apparent Km, 14-22 microM; V max, 24-38 nmol/min/g liver).

The inhibition of covalent binding by ethylenediamine, which reacts specifically with 1,2-naphthoquinone but not 1,4-naphthoquinone, suggested that most of the covalent binding was due to 1,2-naphthoquinone or a metabolite of similar structure.', 'In rat liver microsomal preparations, 1-naphthol is metabolized by the cytochrome p450 mixed function oxidase to 1,4-naphthoquinone and covalently bound species.

Superoxide dismutase, but not catalase, prevented the formation of this spin adduct, further supporting the suggestion that the superoxide free radical was the major oxy-radical formed during the microsomal metabolism of 1-naphthol and the naphthoquinones. These results are compatible with the suggestion that 1-naphthol may exert its toxicity to isolated hepatocytes and other cellular systems by metabolism to naphthoquinones followed by their redox cycling with concomittant generation of active oxygen species, in particular superoxide free radicals.', '...The toxicity of 1-naphthol may be mediated by the formation of 1,2-naphthoquinone and/or 1,4-naphthoquinone, which may then be metabolized by 1-electron reduction to naphthoquinone radicals. These, in turn, may covalently bind to important cellular macromolecules or enter a redox cycle with molecular oxygen thereby generating active oxygen species.

This study describes a subcellular nitroreductase activity which occurs in liver mitochondria under aerobic conditions. Mitochondria were isolated from rat liver and assayed for their capacity to reduce certain nitro compounds by measuring spectrophotometrically both the appearance of amino compounds and the consumption of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Intact mitochondria were found to possess a p-dinitrobenzene reductase activity. The activity was destroyed by heat, and was present at only 20% in the microsomal fraction. It was strictly nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent, while only little or no activity occurred with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or other oxidative substrates. Nitro reduction was inhibited by thiol reagents. Rat liver mitochondria showed about 15% activity with o-dinitrobenzene and m-dinitrobenzene, while there was less than 5% activity with a series of p-nitro compounds including chloramphenicol.', 'The metabolism of radiolabeled dinitrobenzene isomers was compared in hepatocytes and hepatic subcellular fractions isolated from male Fischer-344 rats. Under aerobic conditions, reduction was the major metabolic pathway for m- and p-dinitrobenzene in hepatocytes with m- and p-nitroaniline accounting for 74.0 + or - 1.2 and 81.0 + or - 0.6% (mean + or - SE, n= 4), respectively, of the radioactivity present after a 30 min incubation. The major metabolite of o-dinitrobenzene in similar incubations was S-(2-nitrophenyl)glutathione which represented 48.1 + or - 5.5% of the total radioactivity; o-nitroaniline accounted for 29.5 + or - 2.1% of the radioactivity. Incubation of dinitrobenzene with microsomes produced nitroanilines as well as nitrosonitrobenzenes and nitrophenylhydroxylamines. Reduction of o- and m-dinitrobenzene by microsomes was reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent. Reduction of p-dinitrobenzene could be supported by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as well as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, although the rate of reduction was slower with NADH. Conjugation of o- and p-dinitrobenzene, but not m-dinitrobenzene, with glutathione occurred in cytosol incubations although only o-dinitrobenzene formed the glutathione conjugate in intact hepatocytes.']",

The study shows that superoxide radical which is generated by NADPH-cytochrome reductase is involved in the oxidation of 1,1-diphenylhydrazine to N-nitrosodiphenylamine catalyzed by rat liver microsomes.', 'The enzyme systems in rat liver and lung responsible for the oxidative metabolism of hydrazine derivatives were studied to determine whether these enzymes, cytochrome P450 and monoamine oxidase, were responsible for metabolically activating hydrazines to carcinogenic/toxic metabolites. Cytochrome P450 preferentially oxidized the nitrogen to nitrogen bond of 1,2-disubstituted hydrazines and hydrazides, while monoamine oxidase oxidized the nitrogen to nitrogen bond of all the classes of hydrazine derivatives that were tested. Oxidation of the nitrogen to nitrogen bond led to the formation of stable azo intermediates in the case of 1,2-disubstituted hydrazines and to unstable monoazo (diazene) metabolites in the case of monosubstituted hydrazines and hydrazides. /Substituted hydrazines/', 'By microsomes obtained from bovine ciliary body, 1,1-diphenylhydrazine was oxidized to N-nitrosodiphenylamine in the presence of NADPH. This reaction was stimulated by riboflavin which was recognized to be an electron carrier. The oxidizing activity by microsomes was markedly inhibited by superoxide dismutase, but not by SKF 525-A or carbon monoxide. Similarly, the oxidation of 1,1-diphenylhydrazine to its corresponding nitrosamine occurred in varying degrees when the hydrazine derivative was exposed to visible light in the presence of photosensitizers such as riboflavin, flavin adenine dinucleotide, flavin mononucleotide, lumiflavin, lumichrome, NAD+, NADH, NADP+, or NADPH. The photochemical oxidation was inhibited by active oxygen-scavengers such as superoxide dismutase, L-ascorbic acid or alpha-tocopherol. The superoxide radical involved in the photochemical reaction was determined by measuring the oxidation of epinephrine to adrenochrome. The oxidation of epinephrine was well correlated to that of 1,1-diphenylhydrazine. Thus, the present study provided evidence that the superoxide radical is responsible for the oxidation of a hydrazine derivative to a corresponding nitrosamine by ocular tissue microsomes and by photosensitizers.', 'The first evidence for the reductive metabolism of a noncyclic nitrosamine to the corresponding hydrazine derivative in vivo and in vitro is provided. Under anaerobic conditions, N-nitrosodiphenylamine was reduced by guinea pig liver 9000 g supernatant to 1,1-diphenylhydrazine in the presence of 2-hydroxypyrimidine or to acetaldehyde diphenylhydrazone in the presence of acetaldehyde. These metabolites were identified unequivocally by comparative study with authentic samples. In addition, the study shows that such reductive reactions of the nitrosamine can be catalyzed by guinea pig and rabbit liver aldehyde oxidase in the presence of its electron donors. When the nitrosamine was given orally to acetaldehyde-treated guinea pigs, a metabolite was detected from plasma and identified as acetaldehyde diphenylhydrazone by comparison with the authentic sample.']",

Detoxification by conjugation with glutathione appears to involve direct reaction with methyl isothiocyanate, glutathione S-transferase catalyzed reaction for metham, and the intermediate of either methyl isothiocyanate or metham for dazomet.', 'In a rat metabolism study, dazomet, metam sodium, and MITC were tested at two dose levels. All three were excreted mainly in urine with small amounts excreted in feces. Three different compounds (MITC, carbon dioxide [CO,], carbon oxide sulfide [COSIlcarbon disulfide [CS,]) were found to be excreted in the lungs over a 73 hour collection period. There were no differences between males and females in amounts excreted via the three excretion routes; however, tissue and plasma levels, and plasma area under the curves (AUCs) were consistently higher in females than in males.']",

Gastrointestinal uptake of DNOC increases when 0.2 mL of olive oil is given, whereas 1.0 mL has no influence. Castor oil in a non- purgative dose (0.2 mL) inhibits resorption, and then slows down the decrease of DNOC blood level over a period of 48 h. Rapeseed oil, which is more slowly absorbed than olive oil, shows only a slight inhibitory effect on DNOC digestive absorption.', 'Blood plasma analysis after dinitro-o-cresol dosing of cows showed at least 95% of the absorbed DNOC bound to plasma proteins; the fact that identical doses of DNOC in ruminants give far lower blood concentrations than in rats and rabbits may be explained by the extensive reduction of the compounds in the rumen.', 'When Hedolit (0.1 g) was applied dermally to guinea pigs, it could be detected in the blood serum and to a lesser extent in the testes and semen.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for 4,6-Dinitro-o-cresol (10 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['DNOC appears to be metabolized to less toxic metabolites readily eliminated via the urine. Although small quantities of DNOC may be conjugated, most of the dose appears to be reduced to mono amino derivatives and then subsequently conjugated prior to excretion. These relatively harmless metabolites have been found in the urine and kidney of humans and animals exposed to DNOC.', 'The major metabolic route in the rat and the rabbit following oral administration is by reduction to 6-amino-4-nitro-o-cresol (6-ANOC, 10 - 12% of administered dose) and, to a lesser extent, to 4-amino-6-nitro-o-cresol (4-ANOC), 4-ANOC conjugates and other minor metabolites.', 'In the rabbit, 5% of DNOC single oral doses of 20 or 30 mg/kg is excreted unchanged and 1% as conjugated DNOC in 2-day urine collection. The main metabolic pathway is the reduction of DNOC to 6-amino-4-nitro-o-cresol (6-ANOC), and to a lesser extent to 4-amino-6-nitro-o-cresol (4-ANOC). Urinary content of 6-ANOC accounted for 11-12% of the administered dose. Small amounts of other metabolites, such as 4-ANOC conjugates and 3-amino-5-nitrosalicylic acid (3-ANSA), which is produced via an oxidative pathway, are also excreted in the urine.', 'The metabolism of 4,6-dinitro-o-cresol (DNOC) was studied in rats and in the rabbit. Inbred Wistar-rats received labeled and unlabeled DNOC by gavage in doses of 0.4 to 10 mg/kg bw, with urine and feces being collected separately. When labeled DNOC was administered, blood, a number of organs, and the residual carcasses were collected at sacrifice 1 or 3 days after treatment for use in radioactivity measurements. A female albino white-New-Zealand-rabbit received 76 mg of unlabeled DNOC by gavage, with urine being collected via a catheter at regular intervals over the ensuing 24 hr. ...In rats receiving labeled DNOC in a dose of 0.4 mg/kg, radioactivity was eliminated with a half time of 1-1.5 days. Approximately 25% of the introduced dose was still contained in the body at sacrifice 3 days after treatment, with the major portion being concentrated in the residual carcass. Here, the introduced dose had little effect on the overall pattern of DNOC distribution. The metabolites detected in rat urine were identified as 4,6-diacetamido-o-cresol (DAAOC), 3,5-dinitro-2-hydroxybenzylalcohol, 4-acetamido-6-nitro-o-cresol, 6-acetamido-4-nitro-o-cresol, DNOC, and 6-amino-4-nitro-o-cresol, with 4-acetamido-6-nitro-o-cresol, 6-acetamido-4-nitro-o-cresol, 6-amino-4-nitro-o-cresol, and DAAOC also being present as conjugates. The metabolites detected in rabbit urine were identified as DAAOC, amino-nitro-o-cresol, acetamido-nitro-o-cresol, and 6-amino-4-nitro-o-cresol. The authors conclude that nitro group reduction, followed by acetylation or conjugation, constitutes the major pathway of DNOC biotransformation. When DNOC is administered with a methanol extract of wheat leaves, the major biotransformation reaction is methyl group oxidation.', 'DNOC was rapidly metabolized by rat cecal microorganisms and could /no/ longer be detected after 1 hr. Simultaneously, 6-ANOC (the monoamine derivative of DNOC) was detected in increasing amounts, reaching maximum levels after 1 hr, indicating an 80% DNOC conversion. Thereafter, the 6-ANOC concentration decreased until it represented only 3% of the initial DNOC concentration at 12 hr. DAOC (the diamine derivative) concentrations increased over the entire incubation period and reached maximum levels at 12 hr, when it represented 90% of the DNOC conversion. When incubated alone 6-ANOC concentrations decreased and DAOC concentrations increased in the same time-dependent manner observed in the DNOC experiments. Analogous experiments using DNBP (dinoseb) and 6-ANBP (the monamine derivative of dinoseb) gave similar results. However, the metabolic turnovers were slower. Rat cecal microorganisms metabolize DNOC and DNBP to the corresponding 6-amino compounds, which are in turn reduced to the diamino derivatives. Hematologic effects reported in rats exposed to DNBP may have been induced by amino metabolites formed in the intestine from DNBP metabolism.']","['No reports found; [TDR, p. 567]', 'Formulated DNOC was applied to the shaved skin of male and female rats in a single dose of 18.1 mg DNOC/kg b.w. and was kept in contact with the skin for 8 hr.

Oral gavage studies ... in male rats with (14)C-2,2,4-trimethylpentane (0.5 mg/kg, single dose) revealed that the radioactivity is selectively distributed in the kidneys 72 hr after administration. It has been suggested that the renal retention of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane is related to the hydrocarbon-induced nephropathy observed specifically in male rats.', 'Metabolic disposition of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane was studied in male and female Fischer 334 rats. Rats were treated with a single oral dose of (14)C 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (4.4 mmol/kg; 2 microCi/mmol). Radiolabeled material in kidney, liver, and plasma was determined at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hr after dosing. Maximum concentration of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane derived radioactivity in kidney, liver, and and plasma of male rats was found after 12 hr (1252, 1000, and 403 nmol eg/g, respectively), whereas those measured in females were found after 8 hr (557, 1163, and 317 nmol eq/g, respectively). A selective retention of the 2,2,4-trimethylpentane derived radiolabel in the kidneys of male rats was noted when peak tissue concentration was expressed as a percentage of administered dose. Kidney concentrations of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane derived radiolabel increased in a nonlinear, but dose dependent radiolabel increased in a nonlinear, but dose-dependent, manner; the kidney to plasma ratio was greater at low doses than at higher doses. Increased retention of radiolabel material in the kidney was associated with a significant increase in renal concentration of the male rat specific protein, alpha 2u-globulin, 24 and 48 hr after 2,2,4-trimethylpentane administration. Total radioactivity collected in urine 48 hr after 2,2,4-trimethylpentane administration was similar in males and females (32 and 31% of dose). Identification and quantitation of the urinary metabolites of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane showed that both male and female rats metabolize 2,2,4-trimethylpentane via the same pathway and at a similar rate. Female rats, however, excreted more conjugates of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentanol in urine than males. 2,2,4-Trimethyl-2-pentanol was the major metabolite present in the male rat kidney, but was absent in the female rat kidney. The renal retention of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentanol appears to account for the delayed clearance observed in the disposition of (14)C 2,2,4-trimethylpentane derived radiolabel. Based on the concomitant accumulations in renal alpha 2u-globulin concentration and renal 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentanol concentration, an association is speculated between these two components. The male rat specific accumulation of 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentanol may therefore reflect the accumulation of a metabolite-alpha 2u-globulin complex. This may be relevant to the male-rat-specific nephrotoxicity produced by 2,2,4-trimethyl-pentane.', 'A study was conducted to determine if the rate of uptake and route of excretion of inhaled hydrocarbons and their metabolites might be different for branched alkanes relative to straight chain isomers. Male F344/N rats were exposed by nose only inhalation to nominal concentrations of 1 or 350 ppm (14)C labeled octane and isooctane for a period of 2 hours. Urine and feces were collected as were exhalants at 3, 6, 9, 18, 24, 30, 42, 54, and 66 hr post exposure. Exhalants were also collected at 1 and 2 hr post exposure. Elimination was most exclusively via the kidneys for isooctane while octane was eliminated about equally in urine and as exhaled carbon dioxide. Isooctane was excreted through the kidneys over the entire 70 hr, whereas octane excretion was essentially completed after 10 to 20 hr. At 70 hr after exposure about 5% of the octane equivalents inhaled at 1 ppm remained in the carcass. The author suggests that the different patterns of metabolites excretion of isooctane compared to octane may be a factor affecting the differences in nephrotoxicity between these two compounds.']","['Metabolism of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane probably occurs by omega and omega-l oxidation to yield the corresponding alcohol and acid metabolites. While the exact structure of these remains to be elucidated, there is evidence that the cytochrome p450 system, lauric acid hydroxylases, and palmitoyl CoA oxidase in the liver and kidneys play a role in the biotransformation of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane. Studies indicate that 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (radiolabeled with (14)C) is metabolized by the cytochrome p450 system and that modulation of this enzyme system (with phenobarbital and metyrapone) will alter the disposition and renal retention of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane. Pretreatment of male rats with phenobarbital decreased the expired organics (from 40 to 10% of dose) and increased the urine radioactivity (from 46 to 80%), but did not alter the retention of radioactivity in the kidneys. Metyrapone (an inhibitor of cytochrome p450) increased the elimination half-life of expired 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (2.8 to 3.8 hr), did not alter urinary radioactivity, and decreased radioactivity retention in the kidney by 37%. From these studies, elimination of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane) occurs mainly by metabolism to water-soluble products which are excreted in the urine and by exhalation of parent material.', 'Metabolic disposition of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane was studied in male and female rats.

Skin samples from 3 donors passed the barrier integrity test. A physiological receptor fluid was pumped beneath the skin samples. Skin samples from each of the 6 donors were dosed with neat (14)C-cylohexasiloxane (14C-D6) at a target dose of 6 mg/sq cm during the 24-hour-exposure period.

A single oral dose of (14)C-D6 (in corn oil, 1000 mg/kg body weight) was administered to a group of 4 males and 4 females; metabolism cages were used for the collection of urine, feces, and expired air. The animals were killed at 168 hours postdosing, and selected tissues and remaining carcasses collected and analyzed for radioactivity. Expired volatiles and feces were also analyzed for parent D6 concentration. A separate group of rats (6 males and 6 females), cannulated via jugular vein, was used to determine radioactivity and parent D6 concentration in the blood at 15 minutes and at 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hours postdosing. Wholebody autoradiography (WBA) was used for qualitative in vivo assessment of tissue distribution of radioactivity in male and female rats after single oral administration of D6 (in corn oil). Animals in the WBA groups were killed at 1, 4, 24, 48, 96, and 168 hours postdosing. In males and females, the majority of the administered dose was excreted in the feces. Based on the recovered radioactivity (urine, expired volatiles, expired CO2, tissues, and carcass), the absorption of D6 was 11.88% (males) and 11.83% (females) of the administered dose. For most of the recovered radioactivity, a similar pattern of distribution of the radioactivity was noted in males and females. However, considerable variability in the levels of radioactivity in expired volatiles was reported, which may have been due to off gassing from the fecal pellets that were not collected, as intended, but remained on the inside of the cage. The authors noted that this phenomenon could potentially produce some false high values for expired volatiles and absorption due to partitioning from the fecal matter into the air. All of the radioactivity in the expired volatiles was attributed to parent D6. Metabolic profile evaluation of the urine and feces indicated that all of the radioactivity in the urine consisted of polar metabolites, whereas, in the feces, the majority was parent D6, with a trace nonpolar metabolite. Whole body autoradiography data supported mass balance data showing that the majority of administered D6 in corn oil stayed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and was excreted in the feces within 48 hours. Low levels of radioactivity were detected in organs and tissues, such as the liver, fat tissue, and bone marrow, indicating some absorption of D6. Statistical analysis of blood curves indicated the presence of small amounts of metabolites in the blood, based on the difference between radioactivity and parent AUCs (AUCmetabolites = AUCradioactivity  AUCparent).', 'Silicone [poly(dimethylsiloxane)] gel used in breast implants has been known to migrate through intact silicone elastomer shells, resulting in the clinically observable ""gel bleed"" on the implant surface. Although silicon concentrations in capsular tissues of women with silicone prostheses have been measured with element-specific silicon analyses, no silicone-specific investigation of these tissues has been performed as yet. A combination of element-specific inductively coupled plasma high-resolution isotope dilution mass spectrometry (ICP-HR-IDMS) and species-specific gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyze silicon, platinum, and siloxanes in prosthesis capsule, muscle, and fat tissues of women (n=3) who had silicone gel-filled breast implants and in breast tissue of non-augmented women (n=3) as controls. In all tissues of augmented women, siloxanes, in particular octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5), and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D6) were identified. Depending on the siloxane species and type of tissue analyzed, siloxane levels in the range of about 10-1,400 ng/g were detected; total silicon was found in all tissue samples in the range of about 8,900-85,000 ng/g. Higher platinum levels ranging from 25-90 ng/g were detected in fibrin layer and fat tissue of two patients with prostheses. No siloxanes were detected in control breast tissue samples. This investigation of human tissues by a combination of element-specific and species-specific analytical techniques clearly demonstrates for the first time that platinum and siloxanes leak from prostheses and accumulate in their surrounding tissues.', 'To examine the distribution of low molecular weight silicones in body organs, separate groups of female CD-1 mice were injected with either breast implant distillate composed primarily of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, and tetradecamethylcycloheptasiloxane or a polydimethylsiloxane oil containing low molecular weight linear siloxanes. Mice were injected subcutaneously in the suprascapular area and killed at different times.

The amount absorbed into the skin decreased with time showing that residual D4 and D5 diffused back to the skin surface and continued to evaporate. Overall, a low tendency to pass through the skin into systemic compartments was demonstrated for both D4 (< or = 0.5% of applied dose) and D5 (<0.1% of applied dose).', 'Toxicokinetic studies were performed in rats after dosing by gavage with (14)C-D5 (single dose of 1000 mg/kg bw) dissolved in different vehicles (corn oil and simethicone fluid) and as a neat material. The carrier had a significant influence on the extent of absorption of (14)C-D5. After administration of neat D5, approximately 10% of the dose was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Based on blood area under the curve (AUC), absorption increased after administration of D5 in corn oil and decreased after administration in simethicone fluid. Elimination half-lives for D5-associated radioactivity in blood ranged from 45 (simethicone) to 240 hr (corn oil), and were between 117 (neat) and 242 hr (simethicone) for parent D5. The radioactivity eliminated in the urine consisted entirely of polar metabolites of D5. Mass balance analysis indicated that approximately 60-80 % of the administered D5 was excreted unchanged in the feces, and up to 20% of administered D5 as water soluble metabolites in urine. Half of the systemically available D5 was eliminated as unchanged D5 in exhaled air. However, the kinetics and tissue distribution observed after oral dosing were qualitatively different from the distributions after inhalation or dermal exposures. Higher relative concentrations of D5 were noted in liver and spleen as compared to exposure to D5 by inhalation and dermal application.', 'Separate 77-d fish feeding studies were conducted on the cyclic volatile methylsiloxane (cVMS) chemicals octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane with the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, with the determination of biomagnification factor (BMF) and lipid-adjusted BMF (BMF(L)) values as the final experimental metrics. The studies used fish food concentrations of about 500 ug/g for exposure periods of 35 d, followed by a depuration period of 42 d with clean food. The fish tissue concentrations of D4 and D5 achieved empirical steady-state by day 21 in each study. By day 7 of exposure, total (14)C activity of both compounds had moved from the fish gastrointestinal (GI) tract into surrounding tissue. An absence of significant fish growth during the initial depuration phase allowed for measurement of empirical depuration rate constants (k2) independent of growth dilution for D4 and D5 of 0.035 and 0.040/d, respectively, corresponding to elimination half-lives of approximately 20d. These rate constants indicated that about 70-75% of steady-state was achieved during exposure in both studies, resulting in empirical steady-state BMF and BMF(L) values of 0.28 and 0.66 for D4, respectively, and 0.32 and 0.85 for D5, respectively. Kinetic modeling using simple first-order uptake and depuration dynamics produced good agreement with experimental data, with D4 and D5 assimilation efficiencies of 40% and 44%, respectively. Growth-corrected depuration rate constants modeled over the entire study data set indicated slower elimination kinetics for D4 (k2 of 0.007/d or half-life of 100 d) compared to D5 (k2 of 0.010/d or elimination half-life of 69 d). Kinetic BMFk values (i.e., k1/k2) for D4 and D5 were 1.7 and 1.3, respectively, with lipid-adjusted BMFk(L) values of 4.0 and 3.4, respectively.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for DECAMETHYLCYCLOPENTASILOXANE (13 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['Major metabolites of D5 were identified in urine collected from Fischer (F-344) rats administered ...

Time to maximum plasma concentration was found to be 3.3 hours.', 'Following a single intravenous dose, 73.1 +/- 16% of the dose was excreted in the urine during the 0-24 hour interval.  Post administration of oral carnitine supplements, in addition to a high carnitine diet, 58-65% of the administered radioactive dose was recovered from urine and feces in 5-11 days.', 'The steady state volume of distribution (Vss) of an intravenously administered dose, above endogenous baseline levels, was calculated to be 29.0 +/- 7.1L. However this value is predicted to be an underestimate of the true Vss.', 'Total body clearance was found to be a mean of 4L/h.', 'L-Carnitine is a naturally occurring compound that facilitates the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria for beta-oxidation. ... In humans, the endogenous carnitine pool, which comprises free L-carnitine and a range of short-, medium- and long-chain esters, is maintained by absorption of L-carnitine from dietary sources, biosynthesis within the body and extensive renal tubular reabsorption from glomerular filtrate. In addition, carrier-mediated transport ensures high tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios in tissues that depend critically on fatty acid oxidation. The absorption of L-carnitine after oral administration occurs partly via carrier-mediated transport and partly by passive diffusion. After oral doses of 1-6 g, the absolute bioavailability is 5-18%. In contrast, the bioavailability of dietary L-carnitine may be as high as 75%. Therefore, pharmacological or supplemental doses of L-carnitine are absorbed less efficiently than the relatively smaller amounts present within a normal diet. L-Carnitine and its short-chain esters do not bind to plasma proteins and, although blood cells contain L-carnitine, the rate of distribution between erythrocytes and plasma is extremely slow in whole blood. After iv administration, the initial distribution volume of L-carnitine is typically about 0.2-0.3 L/kg, which corresponds to extracellular fluid volume. There are at least three distinct pharmacokinetic compartments for L-carnitine, with the slowest equilibrating pool comprising skeletal and cardiac muscle. L-Carnitine is eliminated from the body mainly via urinary excretion. Under baseline conditions, the renal clearance of L-carnitine (1-3 mL/min) is substantially less than glomerular filtration rate (GFR), indicating extensive (98-99%) tubular reabsorption. The threshold concentration for tubular reabsorption (above which the fractional reabsorption begins to decline) is about 40-60 umol/L, which is similar to the endogenous plasma L-carnitine level. Therefore, the renal clearance of L-carnitine increases after exogenous administration, approaching GFR after high iv doses. ...', 'In mammals, the carnitine pool consists of nonesterified L-carnitine and many acylcarnitine esters. Of these esters, acetyl-L-carnitine is quantitatively and functionally the most significant. Carnitine homeostasis is maintained by absorption from diet, a modest rate of synthesis, and efficient renal reabsorption. Dietary L-carnitine is absorbed by active and passive transfer across enterocyte membranes. Bioavailability of dietary L-carnitine is 54-87% and is dependent on the amount of L-carnitine in the meal. Absorption of L-carnitine dietary supplements (0.5-6 g) is primarily passive; bioavailability is 14-18% of dose. Unabsorbed L-carnitine is mostly degraded by microorganisms in the large intestine. Circulating L-carnitine is distributed to two kinetically defined compartments: one large and slow-turnover (presumably muscle), and another relatively small and rapid-turnover (presumably liver, kidney, and other tissues). At normal dietary L-carnitine intake, whole-body turnover time in humans is 38-119 hr. In vitro experiments suggest that acetyl-L-carnitine is partially hydrolyzed in enterocytes during absorption. In vivo, circulating acetyl-L-carnitine concentration was increased 43% after oral acetyl-L-carnitine supplements of 2 g/day, indicating that acetyl-L-carnitine is absorbed at least partially without hydrolysis. After single-dose intravenous administration (0.5 g), acetyl-L-carnitine is rapidly, but not completely hydrolyzed, and acetyl-L-carnitine and L-carnitine concentrations return to baseline within 12 h. At normal circulating l-carnitine concentrations, renal l-carnitine reabsorption is highly efficient (90-99% of filtered load; clearance, 1-3 mL/min), but displays saturation kinetics. Thus, as circulating L-carnitine concentration increases (as after high-dose intravenous or oral administration of L-carnitine), efficiency of reabsorption decreases and clearance increases, resulting in rapid decline of circulating L-carnitine concentration to baseline. Elimination kinetics for acetyl-L-carnitine are similar to those for L-carnitine. There is evidence for renal tubular secretion of both L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine. ...', 'The pharmacokinetics of L-carnitine and its metabolites were investigated in 7 healthy subjects following the oral administration of 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 g 3 times a day for 7 days. Mean plasma concentrations of L-carnitine across an 8-hour dose interval increased significantly (P < 0.05) from a baseline of 54.2 +/- 9.3 uM to 80.5 +/- 12.5 uM following the 0.5-g dose; there was no further increase at higher doses. There was a significant increase (P <0.001) in the renal clearance of L-carnitine indicating saturation of tubular reabsorption. Trimethylamine plasma levels increased proportionately with L-carnitine dose, but there was no change in renal clearance. A significant increase in the plasma concentrations of trimethylamine-N-oxide from baseline was evident only for the 2-g dose of L-carnitine (from 34.5 +/- 2.0 to 149 +/- 145 uM), and its renal clearance decreased with increasing dose (P <0.05). There was no evidence for nonlinearity in the metabolism of trimethylamine to trimethylamine-N-oxide. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetics of oral L-carnitine display nonlinearity above a dose of 0.5 g 3 times a day.', 'Evidence indicates L-carnitine is absorbed in the intestine by a combination of active transport and passive diffusion. Reports of bioavailability following an oral dose have varied substantially, with estimates as low as 16 to 18% and as high as 54 to 87% ...

Elimination of carnitine occurs primarily through the kidneys. The heart, skeletal muscle, liver, kidneys, and epididymis have specific transport systems for carnitine that concentrate carnitine within these tissues. Despite evidence indicating incr levels of free carnitine and carnitine metabolites in the blood and urine following an oral dose, no significant change in RBC carnitine levels was noted in healthy subjects, suggesting either a slow repletion of tissue stores of carnitine following an oral dose or a low capability to transport carnitine into tissues under normal conditions.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for L-CARNITINE (11 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['After oral administration L-carnitine which is unabsorbed is metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract by bacterial microflora.

There is a great potential for human exposure to JP-8. In this study, we determined percutaneous absorption and dermal toxicity of three components of JP-8 (i.e., xylene, heptane, and hexadecane) in vivo in weanling pigs. In vivo percutaneous absorption results suggest a greater absorption of hexadecane (0.43%) than xylene (0.17%) or heptane (0.14%) of the applied dose after 30 min exposure.', 'Hexadecane has been identified in two human atherosclerotic aortas at concentrations of 40 and 60 ng/g.', '... Pigs were exposed to JP-8 jet fuel-soaked cotton fabrics for 1 and 4 d with repeated daily exposures. Preexposed and unexposed skin was then dermatomed and placed in flow-through in vitro diffusion cells. Five cells with exposed skin and four cells with unexposed skin were dosed with a mixture of 14 different hydrocarbons (HC) consisting of nonane, decane, undecane, dodecane, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, ethyl benzene, o-xylene, trimethyl benzene (TMB), cyclohexyl benzene (CHB), naphthalene, and dimethyl naphthalene (DMN) in water + ethanol (50:50) as diluent. Another five cells containing only JP-8-exposed skin were dosed solely with diluent in order to determine the skin retention of jet fuel HC. The absorption parameters of flux, diffusivity, and permeability were calculated for the studied HC. The data indicated that there was a two-fold and four-fold increase in absorption of specific aromatic HC like ethyl benzene, o-xylene, and TMB through 1- and 4-d JP-8 preexposed skin, respectively. Similarly, dodecane and tridecane were absorbed more in 4-d than 1-d JP-8 preexposed skin experiments. The absorption of naphthalene and DMN was 1.5 times greater than the controls in both 1- and 4-d preexposures. CHB, naphthalene, and DMN had significant persistent skin retention in 4-d preexposures as compared to 1-d exposures that might leave skin capable of further absorption several days postexposure. The possible mechanism of an increase in HC absorption in fuel preexposed skin may be via lipid extraction from the stratum corneum as indicated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. This study suggests that the preexposure of skin to jet fuel enhances the subsequent in vitro percutaneous absorption of HC, so single-dose absorption data for jet fuel HC from naive skin may not be optimal to predict the toxic potential for repeated exposures. For certain compounds, persistent absorption may occur days after the initial exposure.', 'Rat tissue:air and blood:air partition coefficients (PCs) for octane, nonane, decane, undecane, and dodecane (n-C8 to n-C12 n-alkanes) were determined by vial equilibration. The blood:air PC values for n-C8 to n-C12 were 3.1, 5.8, 8.1, 20.4, and 24.6, respectively. The lipid solubility of n-alkanes increases with carbon length, suggesting that lipid solubility is an important determinant in describing n-alkane blood:air PC values. The muscle:blood, liver: blood, brain:blood, and fat:blood PC values were octane (1.0, 1.9, 1.4, and 247), nonane (0.8, 1.9, 3.8, and 274), decane (0.9, 2.0, 4.8, and 328), undecane (0.7, 1.5, 1.7, and 529), and dodecane (1.2, 1.9, 19.8, and 671), respectively. The tissue:blood PC values were greatest in fat and the least in muscle. The brain:air PC value for undecane was inconsistent with other n-alkane values. Using the measured partition coefficient values of these n-alkanes, linear regression was used to predict tissue (except brain) and blood:air partition coefficient values for larger n-alkanes, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, and heptadecane (n-C13 to n-C17). Good agreement between measured and predicted tissue:air and blood:air partition coefficient values for n-C8 to n-Cl2 offer confidence in the partition coefficient predictions for longer chain n-alkanes.', '1-(14)C n-hexadecane, a model compound for the non-volatile aliphatic hydrocarbon components of crude oil, was administered by intrapericardial injection to the spiny lobster, panulirus argus, and the clawed or American lobster, homarus americanus.

The tissues and fluids were analyzed for (14)C content by digestion or catalytic oxidation and liquid scintillation counting. Selected tissues(hepatopancreas, tail muscle and hemolymph) were extracted with ethyl acetate to allow quantitation of the unmetabolized n-hexadecane by thin layer chromatography. n-Hexadecane-derived radioactivity was very persistent in both the spiny lobster (half-life = 4.6 wk) and the American lobster (half-life = 11.2 wk). In both lobsters, the hepatopancreas acquired the highest specific activity and the tail muscle had the longest half life for elimination from an individual tissue. Although hexadecane was metabolized more rapidly in the hepatopancreas of the spiny lobster than in the hepatopancreas of the American lobster, unmetabolized hexadecane persisted in the hepatopancreases of both species for at least 8 weeks after the dose (the longest time studied).']",,

Over 70% of the material was deposited in the lung of the exposed animals, compared to 13% obtained by traditional exposure methods. There was little external body exposure and therefore little ingestion through preening. Particulate deposition and distribution were quite reproducible, with animal to animal variation of less than 20%. The major disadvantage to the nose only exposure system was that the animals were restrained and not allowed access to food or water during exposure. Results obtained using dotriacontane and catechol were described. For intratracheal inoculation, the material being studied was placed in the lung to allow direct interaction with lung cells. A blunt needle was carefully inserted down the throat of the animal, past the tracheal rings to the bifurcation of the lung where the material was injected. The technique was similar for rats, mice, and hamsters. The procedure was fairly simple and rapid, allowing injection of many animals per day. A wide range of treatment doses could be given and repeated over long periods of time; the chemicals bypassed the upper respiratory tract. The disadvantages to the method included the fact that this was not a normal route of exposure, anesthesia was required, the particle size delivered to the lung may not be uniform, and special care was needed to insure that animals survived the procedure.']",,

The insecticides were derived from a series of 2,4-disubstituted anilines. The compounds studied included 2,4-dichloroaniline. Each compound was orally admin in corn oil solution to 2 female rats & 4 female mice in doses of 10-13 mg/kg. In every case, the corresponding anilines were detected as free aniline, in minor amounts except for the dichloro series. There were no significant differences observed between the compounds studied. The general metabolism schemes for all 4 compounds were similar. Metabolism of these compounds involves rapid hydrolysis of the parent compound in the stomach to simple formamidine, which is then converted to an N-formylaniline that has various metabolic fates, particularly through oxidation of methyl groups.', 'In order to reveal the urinary metabolites of p-chloronitrobenzene (CNB), an investigation was conducted to separate and identify urinary metabolites by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry following the administration of the compound to rats. Six male Sprague-Dawley-rats were given a single dose of 100 mg/kg CNB diluted in olive-oil and injected intraperitoneally. Urine was collected from the six rats at from 8 to 24 hours after exposure. Trace amounts of unchanged CNB were detected in the urine of the rats, but most of the CNB appeared to have been metabolized prior to excretion. Nine substances were identified: p-chloroaniline, 2,4-dichloroaniline, p-nitrothiophenol, 2-chloro-5-nitrophenol, 2-amino-5-chlorophenol, p-chloroformanilide, 4-chloro-2-hydroxyacetanilide, a small amount of p-chloroacetanilide and traces of unchanged CNB.', 'The urinary metabolites of p-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB) in humans were determined using urine samples from acutely poisoned subjects. The six subjects were longshoremen hospitalized after being exposed to p-CNB while loading torn bags of the substance. Moment analysis and compartment model analysis of the urinary excretion rate of metabolites of p-CNB versus time curves were used for the pharmacokinetic evaluation. The findings suggest that the average values of the ratio of excreted amount of each metabolite to the total amount of the five metabolites and mean residence time in the six subjects were, respectively, 12.2% and 6.7 days for 2-chloro-5-nitrophenol (619103), 48.0% and 7.0 days for N-acetyl-S-(4-nitrophenyl)-L-cysteine, 1.2% and 3.7 days for 2,4-dichloroaniline, 29.9% and 10.0 days for p-chloroaniline, and 8.7% and 6.0 days for 2-amino-5-chlorophenol. The rates of transformation of p-CNB to 2-chloro-5-nitrophenol and p-chloroaniline appeared to be slow, but the resulting p-chloroaniline was metabolized relatively rapidly in the human body. The authors note that the ratio of the excretion amounts of the five metabolites was nearly constant among the subjects, whereas the rate of metabolism of the parent compound and the mean residence time varied widely among the individuals.']",

(14)C-Glycidol equivalents were eliminated in urine (40-48% of dose in 72 hr), feces (5-12%), and exhaled as CO2 (26-32%). At both doses, 9-12% and 7-8% (estimated) of the dose remained in tissues at 24 and 72 hr following dosing, respectively. In general, the concentrations of glycidol equivalents in tissues were proportional to the dose.  The highest concentrations of radioactivity were observed in blood cells, thyroid, liver, kidney, and spleen, and the lowest in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and plasma. The pattern of distribution of radioactivity in tissues was similar for both the iv and po routes. The total recovery of radioactivity ranged from 87 to 91% of dose. Urinary radioactivity was resolved by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis into 15 metabolites. There were one major (14-21% of the dose) and four lesser metabolites (each representing 2-8%); the others were minor, each representing 1% or less of the dose. In general, the urinary metabolic profile was similar following either iv or po administration at the two doses studied. Previous studies by other investigators suggested that alpha-chlorohydrin, which was presumably formed from glycidol by the HCl in the stomach, was metabolized and excreted in urine as beta-chlorolactic acid. The results of the present study show that very little, if any, urinary radioactivity coeluted with authentic beta-chlorolactic acid following either iv or po administration. Therefore, it is concluded that the conversion of glycidol to alpha-chlorohydrin is quantitatively insignificant. However, it may be significant with regard to glycidol reproductive toxicity.

We have developed a pharmacodynamic (PD) extension to a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to characterize these dose-response behaviors. The PD model simulates interactions of D4 with a putative receptor, leading to increased production of cytochrome P450 2B1/2. Induction was modeled with a Hill equation with dissociation constant, Kd, and Hill coefficient, N. Both a 1- and a 5-compartment liver model were evaluated. The PBPK model provided excellent simulations of tissue D4 and hepatic CYP2B1/2 protein concentrations following 6 hr/day, 5-day inhalation exposures to 0, 1, 7, 30, 70, 150, 300, 500, 700, or 900 ppm D4. Either the 1- or 5-compartment liver model could accurately simulate increases in CYP2B1/2 protein in the liver. With a 1-compartment liver, Kd and N were 0.67 uM (free liver concentration) and 1.9, respectively. The 5-compartment model used higher N-values (approximately 4.0) and varied Kd between compartments. The fitted 5-compartment model parameters were Kd = 0.67 uM in the midzonal compartment with geometric differences in Kd between compartments of 2.9. On the basis of unbound (free) plasma concentrations, D4 appeared to be a higher potency inducer than phenobarbital (PB).

Exposure concentration leading to a 0.1% increase in CYP2B1/2 protein predicted by the 1- and 5-compartment models were 2.1 ppm and 5.1 ppm, respectively. The 1- and 5-compartment liver models provided very similar fits to the whole liver induction data, excluding the lowest dose, but the 5-compartment liver model had the additional advantage of simultaneously describing the regional induction of CYP2B1/2.', '... The aim of this study was to quantify cyclic volatile methylsiloxanes (cVMS) in blood plasma of pregnant and postmenopausal women, and to investigate possible links to self-reported use of PCPs for the latter group. Participants were recruited from two studies, namely the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study (NOWAC) and the North Norwegian Mother-and-child Study (MISA). For the NOWAC cohort, 94 plasma samples from postmenopausal women were analyzed (blood drawn in 2005) and information about PCP use and breast implants was derived from a self-administered questionnaire. In the MISA study, the collection of the plasma samples (blood drawn in 2009) constituted a re-sampling because the original serum vacutainers used were contaminated with cVMS. D4 (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane) was the dominant compound in plasma for both cohorts. For the NOWAC samples, more than 85% of the women had D4 concentrations above the LOQ (2.74 ng/mL), while the detection frequency was only 18% for the MISA participants. The highest cVMS plasma concentrations were observed for D4: 12.7 ng/mL (NOWAC) and 2.69 ng/mL (MISA). For the other cVMS, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D6) concentrations were below the detection limit in most samples. There was no significant correlation between the concentrations of D4 and the reported total body cream use. Sampling time (2005 versus 2009) and age of the donors could explain the differences between the two cohorts.', 'Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) are cyclic siloxanes used as chemical intermediates with some applications in consumer products. The in vitro percutaneous absorption of (14)C-D4 and (14)C-D5 was studied in flow-through diffusion cells. Single doses were applied neat and in antiperspirant formulations to dermatomed human skin for 24 hr. The majority of applied D4 and D5 (approximately 90%) volatilized before being absorbed. Only 0.5% of applied D4 was absorbed while the absorption of D5 (0.04%) was one order of magnitude lower. The largest percentage (>90%) of the absorbed D4 and D5 was found in the skin. The fate of D4 and D5 absorbed in the skin was studied in rat in vivo. A single dose of (14)C-D4 (10, 4.8 and 2 mg/sq cm) and (14)C-D5 (10 mg/sq cm) was topically applied inside a dosing chamber attached to the dorsal area. Rats were housed in metabolism cages up to 24 hr to enable collection of urine, feces, expired/escaped volatiles. The majority of applied D4 or D5 had volatilized from the skin surface. Less than 1.0% of the applied D4 and only 0.2% of applied D5 was absorbed with approximately 60% of absorbed D4 and 30% of absorbed D5 reaching systemic compartments. The amount absorbed into the skin decreased with time showing that residual D4 and D5 diffused back to the skin surface and continued to evaporate. Overall, a low tendency to pass through the skin into systemic compartments was demonstrated for both D4 (< or = 0.5% of applied dose) and D5 (<0.1% of applied dose).', 'There is potential for human exposure to cyclic siloxanes by the respiratory route. To determine the pharmacokinetics of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4), a material commonly found in personal care products, the respiratory intake and uptake of D4 were measured in 12 healthy volunteers (25-49 years) on two occasions. Subjects inhaled 10 ppm D4 (122 micrograms/liter) or air (control) during a 1-hr exposure via a mouthpiece in a double-blind, randomized fashion. Inspiratory and expiratory D4 concentrations were continuously measured. Exhaled air and plasma D4 levels were measured before, during, and after exposures. Individual D4 uptakes were measured under steady-state conditions during three rest periods (10, 20, and 10 min, respectively) alternating with two 10-min exercise periods. Mean D4 intake was 137 +/- 25 mg (SD) and the mean deposition efficiency was equivalent to 0.74/(1 + 0.45 VE), where VE is the minute ventilation. No changes in lung function were induced by the D4 vapor. Plasma measurements of D4 gave a mean peak value of 79 +/- 5 ng/g (SEM) and indicated a rapid nonlinear blood clearance. Using lung volume and respiratory surface area estimates based on functional residual capacity measurements, we developed a model and determined that the effective mass transfer coefficient for D4 was 5.7 x 10(-5) cm/s from lung air to blood. In an additional eight subjects, we compared D4 deposition with mouthpiece and nasal breathing at resting ventilations. For these individuals, mean deposition was similar for the two exposure protocols, averaging 12% after correction for exposure system losses. These are the first data describing the intake and absorption of D4 and they should contribute to a meaningful safety assessment of the compound.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for OCTAMETHYLCYCLOTETRASILOXANE (20 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['In a recent pharmacokinetic study, six human volunteers were exposed by inhalation to 10 ppm (14)C-D4 for 1 hr during alternating periods of rest and exercise. Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) concentrations were determined in exhaled breath and blood. Total metabolite concentrations were estimated in blood, while the amounts of individual metabolites were measured in urine. Here, we use these data to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for D4 in humans. Consistent with PBPK modeling efforts for D4 in the rat, a conventional inhalation PBPK model assuming flow-limited tissue uptake failed to adequately describe these data. A refined model with sequestered D4 in blood, diffusion-limited tissue uptake, and an explicit pathway for D4 metabolism to short-chain linear siloxanes successfully described all data. Hepatic extraction in these volunteers, calculated from model parameters, was 0.65 to 0.8, i.e., hepatic clearance was nearly flow-limited. The decreased retention of inhaled D4 seen in humans during periods of exercise was explained by altered ventilation/perfusion characteristics during exercise and a rapid approach to steady-state conditions. The urinary time course excretion of metabolites was consistent with a metabolic scheme in which sequential hydrolysis of linear siloxanes followed oxidative demethylation and ring opening. The unusual properties of D4 (high lipophilicity coupled with high hepatic and exhalation clearance) lead to rapid decreases in free D4 in blood. The success of D4 PBPK models with a similar physiological structure in both humans and rats increases confidence in the utility of the model for predicting human tissue concentrations of D4 and metabolites during inhalation exposures.', 'Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) is an industrial chemical of significant commercial importance. In this study, its major urinary metabolites were identified. The urine samples described here were collected from male and female Fischer rats (F-344) administered [(14)C]D4 i.v. The metabolite profile was obtained using an HPLC system equipped with a radioisotope detector. HPLC analysis was performed on a C18 column, using an acetonitrile/water mobile phase. The HPLC radiochromatogram revealed two major and at least five minor metabolites. The two major metabolites, constituting 75 to 85% of the total radioactivity, were identified as dimethylsilanediol [Me(2)Si(OH)(2)] and methylsilanetriol [MeSi(OH)(3)]. Formation of MeSi(OH)(3) clearly established demethylation at the silicon-methyl bonds of D4. No parent D4 was present in urine. The minor metabolites identified were tetramethyldisiloxane-1,3-diol [Me(2)Si(OH)-O-Si(OH)Me(2)], hexamethyltrisiloxane-1,5-diol [Me(2)Si(OH)-OSiMe(2)-OSi(OH)Me(2)], trimethyldisiloxane-1,3,3-triol [MeSi(OH)(2)-O-Si(OH)Me(2)], dimethyldisiloxane-1,1,3,3-tetrol [MeSi(OH)(2)-O-Si(OH)(2)Me], and dimethyldisiloxane-1,1,1,3,3-pentol [Si(OH)(3)-O-Si(OH)(2)Me]. The structural assignments were based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the tetrahydrofuran metabolite extracts, which were derivatized using bis(trimethylsiloxy)triflouroacetamide, a trimethylsilylating agent. The structures were confirmed by synthesizing (14)C-labeled standards and comparing their HPLC radiochromatograms with the corresponding components in the rat urine. GC-MS spectral comparisons of the trimethylsilylated derivatized standards and urinary components also were made to further confirm their identities. Finally, several of the urinary metabolites were fractionated using HPLC, and GC-MS comparisons were again made for positive structural identification. The pathways for metabolite formation are not yet understood, but a mechanistic hypothesis has been proposed to account for the various metabolites observed thus far.', 'The retention, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of (14)C-octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) were studied in Fischer 344 rats after single and multiple exposures to 7, 70, or 700 ppm (14)C-D(4). ...

Under regular physiologic conditions, transport processes of uptake do not saturate. The exact amount of zinc absorbed is difficult to determine because zinc is secreted into the gut. Zinc administered in aqueous solutions to fasting subjects is absorbed quite efficiently (at a rate of 60-70%), however, absorption from solid diets is less efficient and varies greatly, dependent on zinc content and diet composition.    Generally, 33% is considered to be the average zinc absorption in humans. More recent studies have determined different absorption rates for various populations based on their type of diet and phytate to zinc molar ratio. Zinc absorption is concentration dependent and increases  linearly with  dietary zinc up to a maximum rate.  Additionally zinc status may influence zinc absorption. Zinc-deprived humans absorb this element with increased efficiency, whereas humans on a high-zinc diet show a reduced efficiency of absorption.', 'The excretion of zinc through gastrointestinal tract accounts for approximately one-half of all zinc eliminated from the body.   Considerable amounts of zinc are secreted through both biliary and intestinal secretions, however most is reabsorbed. This is an important process in the regulation of zinc balance. Other routes of zinc excretion include both urine and surface losses (sloughed skin, hair, sweat).   Zinc has been shown to induce intestinal metallothionein, which combines zinc and copper in the intestine and prevents their serosal surface transfer. Intestinal cells are sloughed with approximately a 6-day turnover, and the metallothionein-bound copper and zinc are lost in the stool and are thus not absorbed.  Measurements in humans of endogenous intestinal zinc have primarily been made as fecal excretion; this suggests that the amounts excreted are responsive to zinc intake, absorbed zinc and physiologic need.  In one study, elimination kinetics in rats showed that a small amount of ZnO nanoparticles was excreted via the urine, however, most of the nanoparticles were excreted via the feces.', 'A pharmacokinetic study was done in rats to determine the distribution and other metabolic indexes of zinc in two particle sizes.

In-vivo fluorescence imaging using nude mice allowed for studies of tetramethylrhodamine labeled PVA distribution in the body and tracking the urinary excretion. The excreted PVA was studied in detail after collecting the urine of rabbits over a time period of 28 days. The PVA was separated from the urine by dialysis and analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy, (1)H-NMR spectroscopy, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Even after extensive dialysis, it was found that the excreted PVA showed a characteristic brownish color. The spectroscopic techniques revealed that this color was caused by the urine pigment (a metabolite of bilirubin) that could not be separated completely from the PVA. SEC showed unambiguously that the PVA with the very high molar mass had a glomerular permeability in the kidneys. Simultaneously, histological studies of the kidneys and the liver demonstrated that the tissues did not show any obvious damage.', 'Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a polymer with a wide range of molecular weights and uses. Recently, low molecular weight formulations of PVA have been used as components of contraceptive products designed for intravaginal administration in human females. Previous studies in animals have determined that little or no absorption of PVA occurs from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, there is some concern that PVA of lower molecular weights might be absorbed across membranes of the reproductive tract. Consequently, this work has investigated the absorption of low molecular weight PVA across biological membranes of the reproductive and GI tracts of Fischer 344 rats. Oral administration of ten consecutive daily doses of (14)C PVA resulted in little apparent absorption of the dose from the GI tract. In contrast, intravaginal administration of (14)C PVA resulted in increasing concentrations of PVA-derived radioactivity in major tissues following one, three or ten daily doses of the estimated human dose of 3 mg/kg. PVA-derived radioactivity was concentrated mainly in the liver, reaching a peak greater than 1750 ng equivalents/g tissue 24 hours following ten daily doses.

To correlate skin absorption and elimination kinetics of four cyclic terpenes, namely alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, eucalyptol and terpinen-4-ol, applied as neat substance with their physicochemical properties.  The terpenes were applied onto the human skin in vitro, and after 1-4 h their content in the separated by a tape-stripping method stratum corneum layers and in the epidermis/dermis was determined using GC. Similarly, the amounts of terpenes in the skin were analysed during 4 h following 1 h absorption.  The fastest and progressive penetration into all skin layers was observed for terpinen-4-ol. All studied terpenes are absorbed in the viable epidermis/dermis, however penetration into this layers is time-dependent process, constantly increasing during 4 h. Like for stratum corneum, the largest cumulation in epidermis/dermis was observed for terpinen-4-ol. The elimination of terpenes from the stratum corneum was fast, especially in deeper layers, and much faster if the initial cumulation was small.  Investigated cyclic terpenes represent different penetration and elimination characteristics and do not permeate across the skin to the acceptor medium due to large cumulation in the skin tissue. The penetration of terpenes into stratum corneum is greater if their log P-value is close to 3.', ""The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro cutaneous penetration of five terpenes--linalool, linalyl acetate, terpinen-4-ol, citronellol and alpha-pinene--applied in pure essential oils or in dermatological formulations (o/w emulsion, oily solution or hydrogel) containing 0.75 % w/w of the essential oils. Different skin absorption was observed depending on the type of the vehicle and terpenes' log P values. Cutaneous accumulation of terpenes is several times higher when they are applied in pure essential oils than in topical vehicles. Penetration of terpinen-4-ol to the skin was better from an oily solution (approximately 90 ug/cm (2)) than from an emulsion (60 ug/cm (2)). No penetration of linalyl acetate from topical vehicles into viable skin was observed, but also for this terpene penetration to the upper layers of the stratum corneum was 2-times higher when an oily solution was used. In contrast, the cutaneous absorption of linalool was the same from both vehicles (50-60 ug/cm (2)). The skin penetration of alpha-pinene was not traceable when it was applied in an oily solution. Only a small amount (approximately 5 ug/cm (2)) of this terpene was determined in viable skin after application as a hydrogel.

The effect of such excipients was determined by evaluating the absorption of T4OL using human epidermis and the perturbation of the organization of stratum corneum by ATR-FTIR.

Tri-m-cresyl phosphate was excreted primarily in the feces at all four dose levels administered (0.5, 2, 20, or 200 mg/kg); however, as the dose increased the percentage excreted in the feces also increased and that excreted in urine decreased. Tri-p-cresyl phosphate exhibited yet a different excretion pattern; at low doses (0.5 or 2 mg/kg) the primary route of excretion was the urine, whereas at higher doses (20 or 200 mg/kg) the primary route of excretion was the feces. Evaluation of biliary excretion following intravenous administration indicated that after administration of 2 or 20 mg/kg tri-o-cresyl phosphate or tri-m-cresyl phosphate approximately 40% to 60% of the label was excreted in the bile within the first 6 hours. However, tri-p-cresyl phosphate exhibited a dose dependent increase which represented an approximate doubling of biliary excretion between the 2 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg doses.

Two pharmacophores have been identified in flavonoids, namely the catechol group in ring B and the hydroxyl (OH) group at the 3-position.

Of the flavonols tested without a catechol group in ring B, kaempferol (OH groups at positions 3,5,7,4') and galangin (OH groups at positions 3,5,7) are also potent scavengers, whereas apigenin (OH groups at positions 5,7,4') and chrysin (OH groups at positions 5,7) are not.

In vitro methylation of selenium with liver extract from vitamin B12-deficient rats showed one-third to one-half the rate of volatilization of selenium as compared to control rats.

The active forms of selenium involved have not been identified to date, but conversion of selenium via hydrogen selenide (H2Se) to methylated forms such as dimethylselenide and trimethylselenonium ion is an important metabolic fate. By controlling the entry of selenium into various points within this pathway through selection of appropriate starting compounds, it is possible to pinpoint more closely the form(s) of selenium responsible for its anticarcinogenic activity. Selenobetaine in the chloride form [(CH3)2Se+CH2COOH] and its methyl ester are extensively metabolized in the rat to mono-, di-, and trimethylated selenides, largely bypassing the inorganic H2Se intermediary pool. The chemopreventive efficacy of these selenobetaines was determined at 1 and 2 ppm selenium supplemented in the diet throughout the duration of the experiment using the dimethylbenz(a)anthracene induced mammary tumor model in rats. There was a dose-dependent inhibitory response to both compounds, and they appeared to be slightly more active than selenite. These doses were without any adverse effects on the animals. Coadministration of selenobetaine with arsenite (5 ppm arsenic) enhanced the tumor-suppressive effect of selenobetaine, although arsenic by itself was totally inactive. Arsenite is known to inhibit certain steps in selenium methylation. The substantial prophylactic efficacy of methylated selenides and the enhancement by arsenite suggest that partially methylated forms of selenium may be directly involved in the anticarcinogenic action of selenium.']",

Also, the triethyltin products were shown to be metabolized further to diethyltin derivatives in an in vitro system.', 'The reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate and oxygen dependent microsomal metabolism of the di-, tri- and tetra-ethyl-substituted derivatives of germanium, tin, and lead gave rise to ethylene as a major product and ethane as a minor product in rats. These reactions were catalyzed by liver microsomal cytochrome p450-dependent monooxygenase. Since formation of ethane and ethylene was differentially inhibited by anaerobiosis, results suggested that a large portion of the ethane produced was derived by a reductive mechanism. Triethyltin bromide in the absence and presence of the reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate converted cytochrome p450 into cytochrome p420 and affected the function of monooxygenase in vitro. Tetraethyltin caused the reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate and the time-dependent formation of cytochrome p420, suggesting that tetraethyltin was converted into triethyltin salts in significant concentrations. The order of potency in formation of cytochrome p420 was closely paralleled by the ability of tin derivatives to induce microsomal lipid peroxidation in vitro.', 'The metabolism and toxicity of some ethyl-substituted organotin compounds in isolated rat hepatocytes were studied. Tetra- and triethyltin derivatives were metabolized by isolated rat hepatocytes to yield ethane and ethylene. Hydrocarbon formation from tetraethyltin was larger than that obtained with triethyltin bromide and ethylene was the major product (95%) of tetraethyltin metabolism. At a triethyltin salt concentration of 100 uM, the major product formed by cells from untreated rats was ethane. Pretreatment in vivo by phenobarbital resulted in a marked increase in the overall rate of hydrocarbon production and a change in ethylene ratio; ethylene was the predominant metabolite produced. 5,6-Benzoflavone pretreatment in vivo resulted in a small depression in overall hydrocarbon production. No metabolites of diethyltin dichloride (100 uM) by isolated rat heptocytes was detected. Triethyltin bromide (100 uM) was a potent inhibitor of phase 1 (oxidation) and phase 2 (conjugation) metabolism of biphenyl in isolated hepatocytes from phenobarbital-pretreated rats: diethyltin dichloride affected particularly the phase 1 metabolism of the aromatic hydrocarbon. Triethyl- and diethyltin salts reduced O2 consumption and ATP levels in these cells. The triethyl derivative was more effective. Tetraethyltin was not apparently toxic to hepatocytes. Trypan blue dye exclusion and lactate dehydrogenase loss by the cell isolated from phenobarbital-pretreated rats indicated that triethyltin bromide was more toxic than diethyltin dichloride. The diethyl derivative was more potent in stimulating lipid peroxidation as indicated by the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive products than triethyltin.']",

N-Deacetylation of N-acetylbenzidine and N,N\'-diacetylbenzidine by mouse liver microsomes occurred at a rate that was comparable with N-acetylation; while N-deacetylation by rat liver microsomes was relatively slow, only 1-2% of the rate of N-acetylation. In the case of N-hydroxylated derivatives, N-OH-N-acetylbenzidine and N\'-OH-N""-acetylbenzidine hepatic cytosolic N-acetylation by both rats and mice to form N-OH-N,N\'-diacetylbenzidine was quite rapid (0.5-1.9 nmol/min/mg cytosol protein). Hepatic microsomal deacetylation of N-OH-N,N\'-diacetylbenzidine also occurred with both species and was 2-4 times the rate of N-acetylation. These studies indicate that a significant concentration of potentially electrophilic monoacetylated N-oxidized metabolites may accumulate within the liver cell, and that they may serve as intermediates in the synthesis of the highly toxic metabolite, N-OH-N,N\'-diacetylbenzidine. A major metabolic pathway for the formation of N-OH-N,N\'-diacetylbenzidine is proposed as: Benzidine-N-acetylbenzidine-N\'OH-N-acetylbenzidine-N-OH-N,N\'diacetylbenzidine. The activation of N-OH-N,N\'diacetylbenzidine by cytosolic N,O-acyltransferase and N\'-OH-N-acetylbenzidine by cytosolic sulfotransferase and O-acetyltransferase (acetyl CoA-dependent binding to DNA) were also examined. N-OH-N,N\'-diacetylbenzidine N,O-acyltransferase and N\'-OH-N-acetylbenzidine O-acetyltransferase were found to be significant pathways for rat and mouse liver, respectively. In addition, the DNA adduct formed from N-OH-N,N\'-diacetylbenzidine in the presence of partially-purified rat hepatic N,O-acyltransferase was shown to be N\'-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl) N-acetylbenzidine, which is identical to that formed in rat liver in vivo and in the direct', ""(14)C-labeled benzidine was incubated with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA-98 or TA-98/1,8-DNP6 for up to 24 hours. ... Metabolites were studied by thin layer chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography. Benzidine metabolized by TA-98 to two major products: N-acetylbenzidine and N,N'-diacetylbenzidine. Unidentified polar metabolites amounting to 8% of the total (14)C activity were also found. Incubation with TA-98/1,8-DNP6 did not produce N-acetylbenzidine or N,N'-diacetyl benzidine; however, the same polar metabolites as produced by TA-98 were observed. The sensitivity of TA-98/1,8-DNP6 to mutagenesis by benzidine, N-acetylbenzidine and N,N'-diacetylbenzidine was investigated with metabolic activation by hamster liver S9 mix. All three compounds showed mutagenic activity; however, ... TA-98/1,8-DNP6 was less sensitive than TA-98. Salmonella strain TA-98/1,8-DNP6 is deficient in this acetylation activity and resistant to benzidine mutagenesis.

In the presence of rat-liver 9000 g supernatant, benzidine was released from direct black 38 and direct brown 95, whereas hardly any benzidine was produced during incubation of direct blue 6.

Male Wistar rats were pretreated with 0 to 80 mg/kg beta-naphthoflavone. Forty hours later, the animals were /sacrificed/ and hepatocytes and liver microsomes were isolated. After incubation with 4-methoxybiphenyl or biphenyl, the rate of production of 4-hydroxybiphenyl was measured. Hepatic microsomes from rats pretreated with 0 or 40 mg/kg beta-naphthoflavone and incubated with biphenyl or 4-methoxybiphenyl were treated with metyrapone, alpha-naphthoflavone or ethanol and the effects on 4-methoxybiphenyl-O-demethylase (MBPD) and biphenyl-4-hydroxylase (BPOH) activity were investigated. The rate of formation of 4-hydroxybiphenyl from 4-methoxybiphenyl hepatocytes and microsomes from non-pretreated rats was essentially the same as that from biphenyl in hepatocytes and microsomes from rats pretreated with beta-naphthoflavone. MBPD and BPOH activities in microsomes from rats not pretreated with beta-naphthoflavone were essentially the same. MBPD activity was inhibited by metyrapone to a significantly greater extent than BPOH activity. BPOH activity, however, was inhibited to a greater extent by ethanol and alpha-naphthoflavone than MBPD activity. Hepatocytes were incubated with biphenyl with or without beta-naphthoflavone pretreatment and the pattern of conjugation of 4-hydroxybiphenyl was determined. In non-pretreated rats, sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugates of 4-hydroxybiphenyl were formed in approximately equal amounts, each presenting 41 to 44% of the total 4-hydroxybiphenyl formed. In the pretreated rats, the sulfate conjugate represented only 22% of the total 4-hydroxybiphenyl formed while the qlucuronic acid conjugate represented 60% of the total. The /results suggest/ that the difference in cellular metabolism between biphenyl and 4-methoxybiphenyl is due to competition between beta-naphthoflavone and biphenyl or their metabolites for common metabolic pathways. The type of cytochrome P450 involved in forming 4-hydroxybiphenyl does not effect the pattern of conjugation.', 'The response of hepatocytes to 4-hydroxybiphenyl (HP) in the presence of ascorbic acid was investigated in vitro. Livers from male Wistar rats were excised and hepatocyte suspensions were prepared. For assay of 0-demethylation of 4-methoxybiphenyl (MBP) the acidified incubation mixture was incubated with crude beta-glucuronidase. Total HP was extracted and fluorescence was measured. For assay of conjugated metabolites of HP and sequential metabolism of MBP the incubation mixture was extracted to remove unconjugated metabolites of HP and the mixture was treated with crude beta-glucuronidase. Ascorbic acid was added to the cell incubations with preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min before adding the appropriate substrate. During a 60 min incubation of hepatocytes with HP about 55 nanomoles of conjugates were produced; 84% was in the form of glucuronide conjugates. Preincubation with ascorbic acid at 130 to 600 micromoles significantly incr glucuronylation in a dose related manner between 130 and 400 micromoles. Higher ascorbic acid concentrations resulted in sulfation inhibition. Sulfate was the major conjugate produced during the conjugation of HP from MBP in the presence of ascorbic acid. The normal serum concentrations of ascorbic acid did not effect the glucuronylation pathway but high concentrations inhibited sulfation and enhanced glucuronylation to a similar degree. Ascorbic acid did not effect 0-demethylation of MBP nor did it influence cellular lipid peroxidation. The /results suggest/ that high concentrations of ascorbic acid inhibit sulfation of MBP in isolated rat hepatocytes.

Radioactivity was excreted predominantly in the urine after either route of administration, and comparison of the respective excretion profiles indicated that about three-quarters of the applied dose was absorbed through the skin. Plasma concentrations of each parent compound, as determined by radio-HPLC, reached peak values at 2 hr after oral dosing, and remained relatively uniform during 1-6 hr after application to the skin, suggesting constant percutaneous absorption during this period. N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone appeared to be absorbed through the skin more extensively and at a slightly faster rate than 2-pyrrolidinone; total percutaneous absorption tended to be more extensive in female than in male rats. Together, these two 14C-compounds accounted for most of the plasma radioactivity up to 6-8 hr post-administration. However, by 12 hr (when plasma levels were relatively low), most of the radioactivity was associated with unknown polar metabolites. In view of the extensive percutaneous absorption and little first-pass metabolism of the two pyrrolidinones, the oral route was considered to represent a valid alternative to the dermal route for the assessment of the systemic toxicity of the two compounds.']","['THE URINARY EXCRETION OF RADIOACTIVE METABOLITES FOLLOWING THE IP ADMIN OF A RANGE OF DOSES OF 2,5-(14)C-2-LABELED N-NITROSOPYRROLIDINE TO RATS WAS EXAMINED.

To evaluate the toxicity of BPF at the protein level, the effects of BPF on human serum albumin (HSA) were investigated at three temperatures 283, 298, and 308 K by multiple spectroscopic techniques. The experimental results showed that BPF effectively quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA via static quenching. The number of binding sites, the binding constant, the thermodynamic parameters and the binding subdomain were measured, and indicated that BPF could spontaneously bind with HSA on subdomain IIA through H-bond and van der Waals interactions. Furthermore, the conformation of HSA was demonstrably changed in the presence of BPF. The work provides accurate and full basic data for clarifying the binding mechanisms of BPF with HSA in vivo and is helpful for understanding its effect on protein function during its transportation and distribution in blood.', ""The distribution of bisphenol F (4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl-methane, BPF) was studied in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Pregnant and nonpregnant animals were gavaged with a single dose of 7 or 100 mg/kg [(3)H]BPF and were kept for 96 hr  in metabolic cages. The excretion of BPF residues occurred mainly in urine (43-54% of the administered dose), which was found to contain at least six different metabolites, and to a lesser extent in feces (15-20% of the administered dose). Sulfatase treatment and subsequent high-performance liquid chromatography analyses suggest that the major urinary metabolite (more than 50% of the radioactivity present in urine) is a sulfate conjugate of BPF. At 96 hr, BPF residues were detectable in all tissues examined with the largest amounts in the liver (0.5% of the dose). In pregnant rats dosed at day 17 of gestation, BPF residues were detected in the uterus, placenta, amniotic fluid, and fetuses (0.9-1.3% of the administered dose). Large amounts of radioactivity (8-10% of the dose) were still located in the digestive tract lumen at the end of the study. After administration of a single oral dose of [(3)H]BPF, 46% of the distributed radioactivity was excreted in bile over a 6 hr period. In rats, BPF and/or its metabolites very likely undergo enterohepatic cycling, which could be responsible for the relatively high amounts of residues still excreted 4 days after BPF administration. This bisphenol is efficiently absorbed and distributed to the reproductive tract in female rats, and its residues pass the placental barrier at a late stage of gestation in rats.""]","[""Bisphenol F [4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl-methane] (BPF) has a broad range of applications in industry (liners lacquers, adhesives, plastics, coating of drinks and food cans). Free monomers of this bisphenol can be released into the environment and enter the food chain, very likely resulting in the exposure of humans to low doses of BPF. This synthetic compound has been reported to be estrogenic. A study of BPF distribution and metabolism in rats has demonstrated the formation of many metabolites, with multiple biotransformation pathways. In the present work we investigated the in vitro biotransformation of radio-labeled BPF using rat and human liver subcellular fractions. BPF metabolites were separated, isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and analysed by mass spectrometry (MS), MS(n), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Many of these metabolites were characterized for the first time in mammals and in humans. BPF is metabolized into the corresponding glucuronide and sulfate (liver S9 fractions). In addition to these phase II biotransformation products, various hydroxylated metabolites are formed, as well as structurally related apolar metabolites. These phase I metabolic pathways are dominant for incubations carried out with liver microsomes and also present for incubations carried out with liver S9 fractions. The formation of the main metabolites, namely meta-hydroxylated BPF and ortho-hydroxylated BPF (catechol BPF) is P450 dependent, as is the formation of the less polar metabolites characterized as BPF dimers. Both the formation of a catechol and of dimeric metabolites correspond to biotransformation pathways shared by BPF, other bisphenols and estradiol."", 'Bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol F (BPF) are widely used to manufacture plastics and epoxy resins. Both compounds have been shown to be present in the environment and are food contaminants, with, as a result, a low but chronic exposure of humans. However, the fate and possible bioactivation of these compounds at the level of human cell lines was not completely elucidated yet. In this study, /the researchers/ investigated the ability of human cells (intestinal cell line: LS174T, hepatoma cell line: HepG2, and renal cell line: ACHN) to biotransform BPA and BPF, and focused on the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of these two bisphenols, through the use of a novel and efficient genotoxic assay based on the detection of histone H2AX phosphorylation. BPA and BPF were extensively metabolized in HepG2 and LS174T cell lines, with stronger biotransformation capabilities in intestinal cells than observed in liver cells. Both cell lines produced the glucuronide as well as the sulfate conjugates of BPA. Conversely, the ACHN cell line was found to be devoid of any metabolic capabilities for the two examined bisphenols. Cytotoxicity was tested for BPA, BPF, as well as one metabolite of BPF produced in vivo in rat, namely dihydroxybenzophenone (DHB). In the three cell lines used, /the researchers/ observed similar ranges of toxicity, with DHB being weakly cytotoxic, BPF exhibiting an intermediary cytotoxicity, and BPA being the most cytotoxic compound tested. BPA and DHB were not found to be genotoxic, whatever the cell line examined. BPF was clearly genotoxic in HepG2 cells. These results demonstrate that some human cell lines extensively metabolize bisphenols and establish the genotoxic potential of bisphenol F.', 'Bisphenol F (BPF) is present in the environment and as a contaminant of food. Humans may, therefore, be exposed to BPF, and an assessment of this risk is required. BPF has been shown to have genotoxic and endocrine-disruptor properties in a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2), which is a model system for studies of xenobiotic toxicity. In this study, we investigated the ability of HepG2 cells to biotransform BPF, because metabolism may affect the observed effects of BPF, and we compared this metabolic capacity with that of human hepatocytes. Cells were incubated for 24 hours with (3)H-BPF. The culture medium was then concentrated and its metabolites were isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by mass spectrometry. BPF was largely metabolized into the corresponding sulfate by the HepG2 cell line. BPF was metabolized into both sulfate and glucuronide by human hepatocytes, but with differences between individuals. The metabolism of BPF in both HepG2 cells and human hepatocytes suggests the existence of a detoxification pathway. Thus, these two cell models differ in metabolic capacity. It is, therefore, very important, when assessing the toxic effects of substances in vitro, to determine, in parallel, the biotransformation capacities of the model used to extrapolate in vivo.']",

The maximum rate of NDPA depropylation in seven human liver microsomal samples was 1.15 nmol/min/mg (range 0.53-2.60). Troleandomycin, a P450 3A4/5 inhibitor, inhibited depropylation modestly (10-60%) in three of seven samples. Diethyldithiocarbamic acid, a potent 2E1 inhibitor, and a 2E1 inhibitory monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibited the reaction in all samples (23 to almost 100%). No significant inhibition was observed with the 2C9 inhibitor sulfaphenazole or with mAbs to 3A4, 2A6 and 2D6. The 2C8/9/18/19 mAb inhibited depropylation in one sample by approximately 25% and approximately 25% of the activity in another sample could not be accounted for by the inhibitors. Denitrosation of NDPA by three of the microsomal samples exhibited low K(m) values (51-86 microM) while two of these also had high K(m) values (2.6 and 4.6 mM). Purified human P450 2B6 and 3A4 and human P450 2A6, 2C8, 2C9 and 2D6 membranes had high K(m) values relative to their maximum turnover rates and are unlikely to participate in NDPA metabolism at micromolar concentrations. Conversely, purified rabbit 2E1 exhibited K(m) and V(max) values for depropylation of 52 microM and 13.4 nmol propionaldehyde/min/nmol P450, respectively. Values for denitrosation were 66 microM and 1.44 nmol nitrite/min/nmol P450, respectively. The toxicity of NDPA in transfected human liver epithelial cells expressing 2E1 was dose dependent down to 50 microM. No toxicity was observed in control cells or those expressing 2A6. These results indicate that 2E1 is the major human liver microsomal isoform responsible for NDPA metabolism at low micromolar concentrations. We also show that purified P450s catalyze the denitrosation of NDPA at approximately 10-20% of the rate of depropylation and K(m) values for both reactions are the same for each isozyme. This is consistent with the formation of an initial intermediate common to both pathways, presumably an alpha-nitrosamino radical.', 'Urine collected during 48 hours after administration of an oral LD50 dose to rats contained the following compounds: N-nitroso-3-hydroxy-n-propyl-n-propylamine, N-nitroso-2-carboxyethyl-n-propylamine and, to a lesser extent, N-nitroso-2-hydroxy-n-propyl-n-propylamine and N-nitroso-carboxymethyl-n-propylamine.', 'We have identified propionaldehyde, n-propranolo, isopropanol and N-nitroso-2-hydroxy-propylpropylamine following incubation of N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine with a microsomal fraction from rat liver.

Six parasubstituted styrenes were prepared from the corresponding acetophenones by borohydride reduction to p-bromostyrene, p-chlorostyrene, p-cyanostyrene, p-methylstyrene, p-phenylstyrene, and p-methoxystyrene. Styrene derivatives were incubated with liver homogenates with the addition of reduced nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide-phosphate (NADPH) or carbon-monoxide (CO). The conversion of tritiated beta-4-phenylstyrene to alpha-beta-diolstyrene depended on an oxygen source and the presence of NADPH in the microsomal system in order to catalyze the substrate. With p-methylstyrene, p-methoxystyrene, and p-phenylstyrene, metabolic attack was confined to the vinyl group. All six styrenes gave a type 1 difference binding spectrum in the microsomal substrate. The metabolism of p-phenylstyrene was confirmed by its inhibition by the addition of CO and by its stimulation and phenobarbital. The substituents did not affect the spectral dissociation constants or the values for enzymatic epoxidation. The authors conclude that the lack of significant polar substituent effects on enzymatic epoxidation of styrenes is not consistent with earlier studies in which it was determined that the reagent is electrophilic. The discrepancy may be due to the involvement of different species of cytochrome-P-450 enzymes or different modes of substrate action.']",

Female  Wistar rats were given (14)C labeled /methyl isocyanate/ by ip injection or  inhalation exposure, and free and  protein bound radioactivity was determined in blood, brain,  liver, kidney and lung samples. ...  Free and protein bound radioactivity were  present in all tissues within 30  minutes of the injection of methyl isocyanate at doses of 15  and 30 mg/kg. The relative order  of activity in the tissues for both forms of radioactivity  from highest to lowest was kidneys,  liver, lung, brain, blood hemolysate. Brain radioactivity  remained constant over a 10 day  period during which the activity of the other tissues  decreased. Radioactivity was present in  the globin fractions of blood proteins and the  hydantoin fractions of blood and tissue  proteins. Methyl isocyanate exposure by inhalation  produced comparable results.', 'The uptake and distribution of methyl isocyanate were studied in guinea pigs and mice. Male  English guinea pigs ... were exposed to 0.5 to 15 ppm of (14)C labeled methyl isocyanate vapor for 1 to 6 hours.  ... . Male and pregnant female Swiss Webster mice were exposed to 2.10 ppm of  (14)C labeled methyl isocyanate for 6 hours. ... Methyl isocyanate derived  (14)C activity was detected in venous and arterial blood within minutes of exposure; however,  blood methyl isocyanate concentrations in animals exposed by way of the tracheal cannula were  much lower than in those which breathed normally. Methyl isocyanate was cleared slowly from  the blood; most of it was cleared within 3 days. Methyl isocyanate was cleared more rapidly  from the urine than from bile. The highest concentrations of methyl isocyanate in male mice 2 hours after exposure were found in the lung, sternum, gastrointestinal tract, spleen, and  kidney. Twenty four hours after exposure, highest methyl isocyanate concentrations were in the  blood and lung. In female mice the highest concentrations at 2 hours after exposure were found  in the lung, fetus, spleen, uterus, and kidney. After 24 hours the highest concentrations were  in the lung, spleen, and fetus. /It was/ concluded that inhaled methyl isocyanate is taken up  rapidly in the blood. This uptake is much higher in normal animals than in those breathing  through a tracheal tube.', 'The substance can be absorbed into the body by inhalation, through the skin and by ingestion.', 'Through the use of radioactively labeled methyl isocyanate (MIC), the deposition, penetration, and clearance of this highly reactive compound in the airway at the tissue and cellular levels have been directly examined. Guinea pigs were exposed to 14C-MIC vapors at concentrations ranging from 0.38 to 15.2 ppm for periods of 1-6 hr. Solubilization of tissues from these animals showed the airway tissues to have the highest level of radioactivity. In the nasal region, 14C deposition, as monitored by histoautoradiography, was limited to the epithelial layer, was related to dose, and was dependent on the specific epithelial cell type. The squamous epithelium was minimally labeled on the surface and the label did not penetrate the cell layer. However, radioactivity was detected throughout the entire nasal respiratory epithelial layer. The lack of nasal deposition in tracheotomized animals demonstrated that the 14C accumulation at this site was due to the scrubbing action of the nasal region with no contribution from blood recirculation. Cellular localization in the tracheobronchial region showed epithelial and subepithelial deposition in a dose-dependent manner with accumulation of the label at the subepithelial region. Radioactivity penetrated to the level of the terminal bronchiole but was not detected in the alveolar region. The persistence of airway radioactivity over the 48-hr postexposure period monitored suggests the covalent modification of airway macromolecules. Despite its broad specificity and high reactivity, MIC undergoes selective reactions in the airways which are dependent on respiratory region and cell type.']","['S-(N-methylcarbamoyl)glutathione, a chemically-reactive glutathione conjugate, has been  isolated from the bile of rats administered methyl isocyanate ... . The ability of this  glutathione adduct to donate an N-methylcarbamoyl moiety to the free sulfhydryl group of  cysteine was evaluated in vitro... . The glutathione adduct reacted readily with cysteine in buffered aqueous media (pH  7.4, 37 degrees C) and after 2 hr, 42.5% of the substrate existed in the form of  S-(N-methylcarbamoyl)cysteine. The reverse reaction, ie between the cysteine adduct and free  glutathione, also took place readily under these conditions. It is concluded that conjugation  of methyl isocyanate with glutathione in vivo affords a reactive S-linked product which  displays the potential to carbamoylate nucleophilic amino acids.', 'S-(N-Methylcarbamoyl)-N-acetylcysteine, a chemically labile mercapturic acid conjugate, was  identified ...  in the urine of rats dosed ip with  methyl isocyanate (45.2 umol). The corresponding cysteine conjugate, however, was not detected  in urine. ... The fraction of the injected dose of methyl isocyanate which appeared in 24 hr urine as S-(N-Methylcarbamoyl)-N-acetylcysteine ...  was 24.8 +/- 1.9% (mean +/- SD, N=4).  Thus, conjugation of methyl isocyanate with glutathione, followed by metabolism of the  resulting S-(N-Methylcarbamoyl)-N-acetylcysteine adduct ... appears to represent a quantitatively important pathway of biotransformation of methyl isocyanate in the rat. However, in view of the known carbamoylating properties and in vitro cytotoxicity of S-linked  conjugates of methyl isocyanate, it seems unlikely that the glutathione pathway of metabolism  fulfills a conventional detoxification role in the case of methyl isocyanate. In contrast, it  is proposed that carbamate thioester conjugates of methyl isocyanate, which can revert  spontaneously to free methyl isocyanate under physiological conditions may actually contribute  to the multisystem adverse effects of this highly toxic isocyanate in vivo.', '... Methylisocyanate readily forms a glutathione conjugate in the lung after inhalation. From there, the conjugate is distributed to other tissues, where the reactive electrophilic parent cmpd may be regenerated. Such conjugates are considered transport forms of toxicants.', 'Monomethylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine are endogenous substances as well as  metabolites of methyl isocyanate, the /cmpd/ involved in the 1984 accident at Bhopal, India.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for METHYL ISOCYANATE (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.', 'Methyl Isocyanate is a known human metabolite of n-methylformamide.']",

Values of the reaction velocity at saturating substrate concentration (Vmax), the second order rate constant for binding and catalysis (V/K), the Michaelis constant (Km), and the dibasic ester concentration required to produce half maximal inhibition of the reaction rate (Ksi) were computed. The dibasic esters were hydrolyzed to their monomethyl esters by both the olfactory and respiratory mucosal homogenates. No diacid metabolites were detected. The rates of hydrolysis were always greater in the olfactory than in the respiratory homogenates. Vmaxs in olfactory tissue from male rats were 5 to 9 times higher than in respiratory tissue. In female rats, Vmaxs in the olfactory homogenates were 6 to 13 times those of the respiratory mucosa. V/Ks in male and female olfactory tissue were 4 to 11 and 6 to 10 times those in the corresponding respiratory tissue, respectively. When dimethyl glutarate was used as the substrate, V/Ks were similar for male and female olfactory tissue. In the case of dimethyl succinate and dimethyl adipate, V/K values for female olfactory tissue were 0.5 and 2 times those of the male tissues, respectively. The largest Km values in the olfactory tissues occurred when dimethyl adipate was used as the substrate, followed by dimethyl adipate and dimethyl glutarate in that order. The Ki values ranged from 24 to 46.5 millimolar. Female rats were pretreated with 1% bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, a carboxylesterase specific inhibitor. Bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate decreased the rates of hydrolysis of dimethyl adipate, dimethyl glutarate, and dimethyl succinate in olfactory tissue by 79.8, 81, and 72%, respectively.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the percutaneous absorption of JP-8 across pig ear skin and human skin in vitro and to study the effect of JP-8 exposure on the skin barrier function and irritation in Yucatan minipigs. JP-8 spiked with 5.0 microCi of radiolabeled (14)C tridecane, nonane, naphthalene or toluene (selected components of JP-8) was used for the in vitro percutaneous absorption studies with excised pig ear skin and human skin. For in vivo studies, 250 microl of JP-8 or two of its components (toluene or nonane) was placed in a Hill top chamber(R) and affixed over the marked treatment area for 24 hr. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin capacitance (moisture content) and skin irritation (erythema and edema) were evaluated before treatment and at 1,2 and 24 hr after removal of the patches. The components of JP-8 such as tridecane, nonane, naphthalene and toluene permeated significantly through pig ear skin and human skin and the permeation rates were found to be proportional to their composition in JP-8. The steady state flux values of tridecane across pig ear skin and human skin did not differ significantly (P>0.05). Though the steady state flux values of nonane, naphthalene and toluene were statistically different between porcine and human skin (P<0.01), the values were close considering the large variations usually observed in the percutaneous absorption studies. Application of toluene, nonane or JP-8 increased the TEWL, JP-8 being the highest (3.5 times at 24 hr compared to baseline level). The skin moisture content decreased after the application of JP-8, though it was not significantly different (P>0.05) from the baseline level. JP-8 caused a moderate erythema and a moderate to severe edema. Though the edema decreased after 24 hr, the degree of erythema remained about the same until 24 hr. The skin irritation caused by JP-8 was greater than neat toluene or nonane. The TEWL data of toluene, nonane and JP-8 correlated well with the skin irritation data (erythema and edema). Exposure of JP-8, which contains hundreds of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, caused significant changes in the barrier function of the skin as indicated by an increase in TEWL and produced a significant erythema and edema in minipigs. Furthermore, the disruption of barrier function of skin, as indicated by increased TEWL after exposure to JP-8 might result in increased permeation of its own components and/or other chemicals exposed to skin. The present study provides further evidence that pig ear skin may be used as a model for predicting the rates of permeation of chemicals through human skin.', 'Dermal penetration and absorption of jet fuels in general, and JP-8 in particular, is not well understood, even though government and industry, worldwide, use over 4.5 billion gallons of JP-8 per year. Exposures to JP-8 can occur from vapor, liquid, or aerosol. Inhalation and dermal exposure are the most prevalent routes. JP-8 may cause irritation during repeated or prolonged exposures, but it is unknown whether systemic toxicity can occur from dermal penetration of fuels. The purpose of this investigation was to measure the penetration and absorption of JP-8 and its major constituents with rat skin, so that the potential for effects with human exposures can be assessed. We used static diffusion cells to measure both the flux of JP-8 and components across the skin and the kinetics of absorption into the skin. Total flux of the hydrocarbon components was 20.3 micrograms/sq cm/hr. Thirteen individual components of JP-8 penetrated into the receptor solution. The fluxes ranged from a high of 51.5 micrograms/sq cm/hr (an additive, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether) to a low of 0.334 micrograms/sq cm/hr (tridecane). Aromatic components penetrated most rapidly. Six components (all aliphatic) were identified in the skin. Concentrations absorbed into the skin at 3.5 hr ranged from 0.055 micrograms per gram skin (tetradecane) to 0.266 micrograms per gram skin (undecane). These results suggest: (1) that JP-8 penetration will not cause systemic toxicity because of low fluxes of all the components; and (2) the absorption of aliphatic components into the skin may be a cause of skin irritation.', 'Rat tissue:air and blood:air partition coefficients (PCs) for octane, nonane, decane, undecane, and dodecane (n-C8 to n-C12 n-alkanes) were determined by vial equilibration.

There is a great potential for human exposure to JP-8. Quantitation of percutaneous absorption of JP-8 is necessary for assessment of health hazards involved in its occupational exposure. In this study, we selected three aliphatic (dodecane, tridecane, and tetradecane) and two aromatic (naphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene) chemicals, which are major components of JP-8. We investigated the changes in skin lipid and protein biophysics, and macroscopic barrier perturbation from dermal exposure of the above five chemicals. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to investigate the biophysical changes in stratum corneum (SC) lipid and protein. FTIR results showed that all of the above five components of JP-8 significantly (P<0.05) extracted SC lipid and protein. Macroscopic barrier perturbation was determined by measuring the rate of transepidermal water loss (TEWL). All of the five JP-8 components studied, caused significant (P<0.05) increase in TEWL in comparison to control. We quantified the amount of chemicals absorbed assuming 0.25 sq m body surface area exposed for 8 hr. Our findings suggest that tridecane exhibits greater permeability through skin among aliphatic and naphthalene among aromatic JP-8 components. Amount of chemicals absorbed suggests that tridecane, naphthalene and its methyl derivatives should be monitored for their possible systemic toxicity.', '... JP-8 is a complex mixture containing >200, mostly toxic, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon compounds of which tetradecane and naphthalene were chosen as two representative chemical markers for computer simulations. Thus, transport and deposition of naphthalene and tetradecane vapors have been simulated in models of the human respiratory system. The inspiratory deposition data were analyzed in terms of regional deposition fractions (DFs) and deposition enhancement factors (DEF). The vapor depositions are affected by vapor properties (e.g. diffusivity), airway geometric features, breathing patterns, inspiratory flow rates, as well as airway-wall absorption parameter. Specifically, the respiratory uptake of vapors is greatly influenced by the degree of airway-wall absorption. For example, being an almost insoluble species in the mucus layer, the deposition of tetradecane vapor is nearly zero in the extrathoracic and tracheobronchial (TB) airways, that is, the DF is <1%. The remaining vapors may penetrate further and deposit in the alveolar airways. The DF of tetradecane vapors during inhalation in the alveolar region can range from 7% to 24%, depending on breathing waveform, inhalation rate, and thickness of the mucus layer. In contrast, naphthalene vapor almost completely deposits in the extrathoracic and TB airways and hardly moves downstream and deposits in the respiratory zone. The DFs of naphthalene vapor in the extrathoracic airways from nasal/oral to trachea under normal breathing conditions (Q = 15-60 L/min) are about 12-34%, although they are about 66-87% in the TB airways. In addition, the variation of breathing routes (say, from nasal breathing to oral breathing) may influence the vapor deposition in the regions of nasal and oral cavities, nasopharynx and oropharynx, but hardly affects the deposition at and beyond the larynx. The different deposition patterns of naphthalene and tetradecane vapors in the human respiratory system may indicate different toxic and hence health effects of these toxic jet-fuel components.', 'Rat tissue:air and blood:air partition coefficients (PCs) for octane, nonane, decane, undecane, and dodecane (n-C8 to n-C12 n-alkanes) were determined by vial equilibration.

The metabolism was assessed by measuring the disappearance of parent compound by gas chromatography.

Preexposed and unexposed skin was then dermatomed and placed in flow-through in vitro diffusion cells. Five cells with exposed skin and four cells with unexposed skin were dosed with a mixture of 14 different hydrocarbons (HC) consisting of nonane, decane, undecane, dodecane, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, ethyl benzene, o-xylene, trimethyl benzene (TMB), cyclohexyl benzene (CHB), naphthalene, and dimethyl naphthalene (DMN) in water + ethanol (50:50) as diluent. Another five cells containing only JP-8-exposed skin were dosed solely with diluent in order to determine the skin retention of jet fuel HC. The absorption parameters of flux, diffusivity, and permeability were calculated for the studied HC. The data indicated that there was a two-fold and four-fold increase in absorption of specific aromatic HC like ethyl benzene, o-xylene, and TMB through 1- and 4-d JP-8 preexposed skin, respectively. Similarly, dodecane and tridecane were absorbed more in 4-d than 1-d JP-8 preexposed skin experiments. The absorption of naphthalene and DMN was 1.5 times greater than the controls in both 1- and 4-d preexposures. CHB, naphthalene, and DMN had significant persistent skin retention in 4-d preexposures as compared to 1-d exposures that might leave skin capable of further absorption several days postexposure. The possible mechanism of an increase in HC absorption in fuel preexposed skin may be via lipid extraction from the stratum corneum as indicated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. This study suggests that the preexposure of skin to jet fuel enhances the subsequent in vitro percutaneous absorption of HC, so single-dose absorption data for jet fuel HC from naive skin may not be optimal to predict the toxic potential for repeated exposures.

Three different pools of lipids were isolated according to the sequential procedure used: ""unbound"" lipids extractable by solvents, lipids released under basic conditions (""ester bound"") and lipids released by acid hydrolysis (""amide bound""). Even-carbon-numbered, n-fatty acids were identified in the ""unbound"" lipids of both the acetate and n-icosane cultures. In addition to these compounds, n-icosane induced the formation of n-icosan-1-ol and n-icos-11-en-1-ol, and also of a series of ß-hydroxy acids ranging from C12 to C20. In the ""ester bound"" lipids of the two cultures, short and long chain fatty acids were identified together with the ß-hydroxy C12:0 acid. This hydroxy acid was, by far, the major compound identified in the ""amide bound"" lipids of the two cultures. Comparison of the analytical data for the two cultures, and the differences in composition thus observed for the ""unbound"" pool, suggest the following metabolic pathway for n-icosane: hydroxylation to the C20 primary alcohol, transformation into the C20 ß-hydroxy acid and subsequent degradation into lower homologues. In sharp contrast, lipids from the ""ester bound"" and ""amide bound"" pools were quite unaffected by the change of nutrient. Lipids from Escherichia coli were also examined in the same manner. The results are discussed in terms of geochemical implications, relative to the presence of ""unbound"" ß-hydroxy acids in particulate matter and sediments.']",

In humans, clearance by exhalation is slower in comparison to rats. Biotransformation of MTBE and ETBE is both qualitatively and quantitatively similar in humans and rats after inhalation exposure under identical conditions. The extent of biotransformation of TAME is also quantitatively similar in rats and humans; the metabolic pathways, however, are different. ...', 'To contribute to the characterization of potential adverse effects of ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), its biotransformation was compared in humans and rats after inhalation exposure. Human volunteers (3 males and 3 females) and rats (5 males and 5 females) were exposed to 4 (4.5+/-0.6) and 40 (40.6+/-3.0) ppm ETBE for 4 hr in a dynamic exposure system. Urine samples from rats and humans were collected for 72 hr at 6-hr intervals, and blood samples were taken in regular intervals for 48 hr. In urine, ETBE and the ETBE-metabolites tert-butanol (t-butanol), 2-methyl-1,2-propane diol, and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate were quantified; ETBE and t-butanol were determined in blood samples. After the end of the exposure period to inhalation of 40-ppm ETBE, blood concentrations of ETBE were found at 5.3+/-1.2 uM in rats and 12.1+/-4.0 uM in humans. The ETBE blood concentrations, after inhalation of 4-ppm ETBE, were 1.0+/-0.7 uM in rats and 1.3+/-0.7 uM in humans. ETBE was rapidly cleared from blood. After the end of the 40-ppm ETBE exposure period, the blood concentrations of t-butanol were 13.9+/-2.2 uM in humans and 21.7+/-4.9 uM in rats. After 4-ppm ETBE exposure, blood concentrations of t-butanol were 1.8+/-0.2 uM in humans and 5.7+/-0.8 uM in rats. t-Butanol was cleared from human blood with a half-life of 9.8+/-1.4 hr in humans after 40-ppm ETBE exposure. In urine samples from controls and in samples collected from the volunteers and rats before the exposure, low concentrations of t-butanol, 2-methyl-1,2-propane diol, and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate were present. In the urine of both humans and rats exposed to ETBE, the concentrations of these compounds were significantly increased. 2-Hydroxy-isobutyrate was recovered in urine as the major excretory product formed from ETBE; t-butanol and 2-methyl-1,2-propane diol were minor metabolites. All metabolites of ETBE excreted with urine were rapidly eliminated in both species after the end of the ETBE exposure. Excretion half-lives for the different urinary metabolites of ETBE were between 10.2 and 28.3 hr in humans and 2.6 and 4.7 hr in rats. The obtained data indicate that ETBE biotransformation and excretion are similar for rats and humans, and that ETBE and its metabolites are rapidly excreted by both species. Between 41 and 53% of the ETBE retained after the end of the exposure was recovered as metabolites in the urine of both humans and rats.', '... Eight healthy male volunteers were exposed to ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) vapor (0, 5, 25, and 50 ppm) during 2 hr of light physical exercise. ETBE and the proposed metabolites tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and acetone were analyzed in exhaled air, blood, and urine. Compared to a previous MTBE study lower respiratory uptake of ETBE (32-34%) was seen as well as a slightly higher respiratory exhalation (45-50% of absorbed ETBE). The kinetic profile of ETBE could be described by four phases in blood (average half-times of 2 min, 18 min, 1.7 hr, and 28 hr) and two phases in urine (8 min and 8.6 hr). Postexposure half-times of TBA in blood and urine were on average 12 and 8 hr, respectively. The 48-hr pulmonary excretion of TBA accounted for 1.4-3.8% of the absorbed ETBE, on an equimolar basis. Urinary excretion of ETBE and TBA was low, below 1% of the ETBE uptake, indicating further metabolism of TBA or other routes of metabolism and elimination. The kinetics of ETBE and TBA were linear up to 50 ppm. ...', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for Ethyl tert-butyl ether (7 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['Following cessation of exposure, the blood concentration of ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) falls rapidly, largely as a result of its metabolism to tertiary-butyl alcohol (TBA) and acetaldehyde. TBA may be further metabolized, first to 2-methyl-1,2-propanediol and then to 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, the two dominant metabolites found in urine of volunteers and rats. ...', 'The biotransformation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) was studied in humans and in rats after inhalation of 4 and 40 ppm of MTBE, ETBE, and TAME, respectively, for 4 hours, and the biotransformation of MTBE and TAME was studied after ingestion exposure in humans to 5 and 15 mg in water. tert-Butyl alcohol (TBA), a TBA conjugate, 2-methyl-1,2-propanediol, and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate were found to be metabolites of MTBE and ETBE. tert-Amyl alcohol (TAA), free and glucuronidated 2-methyl-2,3-butanediol (a glucuronide of TAA), 2-hydroxy-2-methyl butyrate, and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl butyrate were found to be metabolites of TAME. After inhalation, MTBE, ETBE, and TAME were rapidly taken up by both rats and humans; after termination of exposure, clearance from blood of the ethers by exhalation and biotransformation to urinary metabolites occurred with half-times of less than 7 hours in rats and humans. Biotransformation of MTBE and ETBE was similar in humans and rats after inhalation exposure. 2-Hydroxyisobutyrate was recovered as a major product in urine. All metabolites of MTBE and ETBE excreted with urine were eliminated with half-times of less than 20 hours. Biotransformation of TAME was qualitatively similar in rats and humans, but the metabolic pathways were different. In humans, 2-methyl-2,3-butanediol, 2-hydroxy-2-methyl butyrate, and 3-hydroxy-3methyl butyrate were recovered as major urinary products. In rats, however, 2-methyl-2,3-butanediol and its glucuronide were major TAME metabolites recovered in urine. After ingestion of MTBE and TAME, both compounds were rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Hepatic first-pass metabolism of these ethers was not observed, and a significant part of the administered dose was transferred into blood and cleared by exhalation. Metabolic pathways for MTBE and TAME and kinetics of excretion were identical after ingestion and inhalation exposures. ...', 'Oxidative demethylation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) and deethylation of ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) by CYP enzymes results in the formation of tertiary alcohols and aldehydes, both potentially toxic. The metabolism of these three alkoxyethers was studied in a panel of 12 human liver microsomes. The relatively low apparent Km(1) was 0.25+/-0.17 (mean+/-SD), 0.11+/-0.08 and 0.10+/-0.07 mM and the high apparent Km(2) was 2.9+/-1.8, 5.0+/-2.7 and 1.7+/-1.0 mM for MTBE, ETBE and TAME, respectively. Kinetic data, correlation studies, chemical inhibition and metabolism by heterologously expressed human CYPs support the assertion that the major enzyme involved in MTBE, ETBE and TAME metabolisms is CYP2A6, with a minor contribution of CYP3A4 at low substrate concentration.', '/The/ human liver is active in metabolizing methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) to tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), a major circulating metabolite and an exposure marker of MTBE. The activity is localized in the microsomal fraction but not in the cytosol. Formation of TBA in human liver microsomes is NADPH-dependent and is significantly inhibited by carbon monoxide, which inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. These results provide strong evidence that CYP enzymes play a critical role in the metabolism of MTBE in human livers. Human liver is also active in the oxidative metabolism of 2 other gasoline ethers, ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME). ... A large interindividual variation in metabolizing these gasoline ethers /was observed/ in 15 microsomal samples prepared from normal human livers. The activity level (pmol metabolite/min/mg) ranged from 204 to 2,890 for MTBE; 179 to 3,134 for ETBE; and 271 to 8,532 for TAME. The microsomal activities in metabolizing MTBE, ETBE, and TAME correlated highly with each other (r = 0.91 to 0.96), suggesting that these ethers are metabolized by the same enzyme(s). Correlation analysis of the ether-metabolizing activities with individual CYP enzyme activities in the human liver microsomes showed that the highest degree of correlation was with CYP isoform 2A6 (CYP2A6)+ (r = 0.94 for MTBE, 0.95 for ETBE, and 0.90 for TAME), which is constitutively expressed in human livers and known to be polymorphic. CYP2A6 displayed the highest turnover number in metabolizing gasoline ethers among a battery of human CYP enzymes expressed in human B-lymphoblastoid cells. CYP2A6 coexpressed with human CYP reductase by a baculovirus expression system was also more active than CYP isoform 2E1 (CYP2E1) in the metabolism of MTBE, ETBE, and TAME. Kinetic studies on MTBE metabolism with human liver microsomes (n = 3) exhibited an apparent Michaelis constant (Km) of 28 to 89 uM and a maximum rate of metabolism (Vmax) of 215 to 783 pmol/min/mg. Metabolism of MTBE, ETBE, and TAME by human liver microsomes was inhibited by coumarin, a known substrate of human CYP2A6, in a concentration-dependent manner. Monoclonal antibody against human CYP2A6 caused a significant inhibition (75% to 95%) of the metabolism of MTBE, ETBE, and TAME in human liver microsomes. ...', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for Ethyl tert-butyl ether (9 total), please visit the HSDB record page.', 'Tert-butyl ethyl ether (ETBE) has known human metabolites that include tert-butanol.']",

Mild to moderate lower-respiratory tract infections due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes may also be treated. Erythromycin treats listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes may also be treated with erythromycin. Erythromycin is indicated to treat pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis. It is effective in eliminating the causative organism from the nasopharynx of infected individuals, rendering them noninfectious. Clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may aid in the prevention of pertussis infection for individuals who have been exposed to the bacteria. Respiratory tract infections due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae may also be treated with erythromycin.  Despite the fact that no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted to this date, in vitro and certain preliminary clinical study results indicate that erythromycin may be an effective treatment in  Legionnaires’ Disease. Finally, erythromycin is indicated to treat diphtheria and other infections due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae, as an adjunct to antitoxin, to prevent carrier status and to eradicate the organism in existing carriers. In addition to the prevention of diphtheria, erythromycin can be used to prevent rheumatic fever in penicillin intolerant patients.    **Skin infections**  Mild to moderate skin or skin structure infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus may be treated with erythromycin, however, resistant staphylococcal organisms may emerge. Erythromycin can also be used to treat erythrasma, an infectious condition caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum.   **Gastrointestinal infections**  Intestinal amebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica can be treated with oral erythromycin. Extraenteric amebiasis warrants treatment with other antimicrobial drugs.   **Genital infections/STIs**  Erythromycin can be used as an alternative drug in treating acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by N. gonorrheae in female patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity or intolerance to penicillin. Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, can be treated with erythromycin.  It serves as an alternative treatment for primary syphilis in patients who have demonstrated penicillin hypersensitivity. Erythromycin can also be used in the primary stage of primary syphilis. Another approved indication of erythromycin is to treat chlamydial infections that cause conjunctivitis of the newborn, pneumonia of infancy, and urogenital infections occurring in pregnancy. It is indicated as an alternative option to tetracyclines for the treatment of uncomplicated rectal, urethral and endocervical infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.

How the site of uptake depends on the physicochemical properties of inhaled vapors has been the subject of experiment and speculation for decades, but remains undefined. Using techniques that distinguish between vapor uptake in the nose and lung during cyclic breathing by Beagle dogs, uptake of the vapors of 2,4-dimethypentane, propyl ether, butanone, dioxolane, and ethanol was examined. These compounds have blood/air partition coefficients ranging from 1 to 2000. The effect of altering respiratory rates on vapor uptake was examined for 2,4-dimethypentane and dioxolane vapors. Deposition of vapors in the nasal cavity during inhalation was highly dependent on the partition coefficient. Vapor deposited in the nasal mucosa during inhalation was desorbed to a substantial extent during exhalation. Lung uptake of total inhaled vapor was limited by the amount available after passage through the nose, but in no case did it exceed 50% of the available amount. The data suggest that the diffusion of vapor molecules through the tissue barrier separating the air/tissue interface from the tissue/blood interface constitutes a significant resistance for both nasal uptake and lung uptake of many inhaled vapors. The data were used to validate a mathematical model describing nasal uptake of vapors.', '... Three beagle dogs were exposed to dioxolane at nominal vapor concentrations of 500 ppm; vapor sampling was triggered for the entire inspiratory and expiratory portions of the breathing cycle during 10-min exposures. After correcting data to account for vapor that desorbed from the nasal passages during exhalation (after initially being absorbed in the nose during inhalation), net nasal uptake of dioxolane was 66.6%. Lung uptake was 2.1% for dioxolane. It can be concluded from this study that upper respiratory tract uptake of dioxolane is an important absorption mechanism for dogs under these experimental conditions. Upper respiratory tract absorption is likely to also be an important uptake mechanism in humans.']",,

We previously reported that mammalian cells incorporate significant quantities of radiolabeled n-docosanol. Herein, we report that cells extensively metabolize the internalized fatty alcohol. This is evidenced by incorporation of up to 60% of cell-associated radiolabel into phospholipids that copurify with phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Analysis by chemical (Vitride) reduction suggests that a significant portion of n-docosanol is oxidized to n-docosanoic acid and then incorporated as an acyl group on polar lipids. A measurable amount of radiolabel, however, is resistant to Vitride reduction, consistent with incorporation of n-docosanol into ether lipids. The rate and extent of metabolic conversion of n-docosanol vary with the cell type and surfactant used to suspend the compound. Furthermore, the anti-HSV activity of n-docosanol is quantitatively proportional to the amount of metabolism observed.

IN VITRO STUDIES WITH RAT LIVER SLICES INDICATED OXIDATIVE DEMETHYLATION, WITH SIMULTANEOUS FORMATION OF FORMALDEHYDE."", 'The metabolism of hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), aminopyrine, ethoxycoumarin, ethoxyrsorufin, and pentoxyresorufin, by the monooxygenase cytochrome p450 dependent system, was studied in microsomes from nasal epithelial membranes and liver tissue of Sprague-Dawley rats. Nasal metabolism rates for the different substrates ranged from 9% of liver values for aminopyrine to 83% for ethoxycoumarin. HMPA-demethylase activity followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics in nasal mucosa microsomes but was biphasic in those from liver. SKF 525A, metyrapone, dioxolane and alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF), inhibitors of various p450 monoxygenase, were examined with regard to inhibition of nasal and liver ethoxycoumarin deethylase. In addition, activity of epoxide hydrolase, glutathione S-transferase, DT-diaphorase and UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UDP-GT) in nasal tissue homogenates were investigated. These activities were lower than those present in the liver. Various attempts to increase the activity of oxidative enzymes in nasal tissue by PB, 3-MC and ethanol failed, 3-MC and PB doubled the microsomal UDP-GT and the epoxide hydrolase activities. The results together with data from the literature sugggest that the balance between p450 isozymes and detoxifying enzymes differs in the nose compared with the liver. The activities of these enzymes in nasal tissue of different strains of rats also varies substantially with implications regarding the metabolic fate and activation of inhaled xenobiotics.', 'Two unique forms of cytochrome p450 (p450), designated NMa and NMb, were recently isolated in this laboratory from nasal microsomes of rabbits. In the present study, polyclonal antibodies to the pruified nasal cytochrome were prepared. Immunochemical analysis with specific rabbit anti-NMa and sheep anti-NMb antibodies indicated that p450 isozymes identical to or having a high structural homology with NMa are present in both olfactory and respiratory mucosa, as well as in liver, but NMb was detected only in the olfactory mucosa. Neither form was detected in other tissues examined, including brain, esophageal mucosa, heart, intestinal mucosa, kidney, and lung. The specific occurrence of NMb in the olfactory mucosa was further substantiated by the detection and specific inhibition by anti-NMb of the formation of unique NMb-dependent metabolites of testosterone in olfactory microsomes but not in microsomes from liver or respiratory mucosa. Similar experiments with antibody to previously purified rabbit hepatic p450 isozymes indicated that not all of the hepatic cytochromes are expressed in the nasal tissues. Thus, p450 isozymes structurally homologous to hepatic forms 2, 3a, and 4, but not 3b and 6, were found in the olfactory mucosa. On the other hand, only form 2 was detected in the respiratory mucosa. Immunoquantitation experiments revealed that NMa nd NMb are the major p450 forms in olfactory microsomes, whereas NMa and P450 form 2 (or its homolog) constitute the major portion of the respiratory nasal microsomal p450. The level of NMa in the liver is relatively low, accounting for less than 3% of total microsomal p450 in this tissue. In addition, evidence is provided that NMa is the major catalyst in the dealkylation of two nasal carcinogens, hexamethylphosphoramide and phenacetin, in both olfactory and respiratory nasal microsomes.', 'Possible roles of chtochrome p450 monooxygenases in nasal tissues are discussed. Nasal cytochrome p450 is known to occur in dogs, rats, monkeys mice, guinea pigs, and Syrian hamsters, and possible other species. The concentrations of cytochrome p450 in the olfactory mucosa of monkeys, dogs, and rats is much higher than in the nasal rspiratory mucosa. The substrate specificity of nasal cytochrome p450 is different from that of the liver. For example, whereas liver cytochrome p450 oxidizes benoz(a)pyrene faster than nasal cytochrome, the reverse is true for hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA). Nasal cytochrome p450 may be involved in producing toxic or carcinogenic metabolites from inhaled compounds. For exampe, HMPA may be demethylated to formaldehyde by nasal cytochrome p450. Nasal cytochrome p450 may have a role in protecting lungs, since nasal metabolism of inhaled organic vapors can reduce the concentration of the vapors reaching the lungs. Nasal cytochrome p450 may help maintain acuity of the sense of smell through removal of odorants by metabolizing them. Without this function, odorants remaining in the mucus covering of the sensory organs might produce an unacceptably high background odor, thereby decreasing acuity. In species that are highly dependent on the sense of smell, the lack of olfactory acuity could have serious debilitating effects.', 'Hexamethylphosphoramide has known human metabolites that include Pentamethylphosphoramide.']",

(14)C from rat hemolysate was distributed between the hemoglobin and small molecular weight (glutathione-containing) fractions. In all other species, the (14)C eluted almost exclusively with the glutathione-containing fractions. In equilibrium dialysis experiments, human hemoglobin did not bind phenyldichloroarsine, whereas rat hemoglobin bound 2 phenyldichloroarsine/mol with Kd approximately 5 m. In conclusion, glutathione is the principle binding site of phenyldichloroarsine in erythrocytes. In most species,the arsenical does not bind to hemoglobin, even though it has free (titratable) sulfhydryls considerably in excess of the glutathione concentration. In rat erythrocytes, phenyldichloroarsine binds both to glutathione and to hemoglobin.']",,

However, in vitro the carboxylating enzyme was inactive with phenol; only phenylphosphate (phosphoric acid monophenyl ester) was readily carboxylated. We demonstrate in a denitrifying Pseudomonas strain that phenylphosphate is the first detectable product formed from phenol in whole cells and that subsequent phenylphosphate consumption parallels 4-hydroxybenzoate formation. These kinetics are consistent with phosphorylation being the first step in anaerobic phenol degradation. Various cosubstrates failed so far to act as phosphoryl donor for net phosphorylation of phenol in cell extracts. Yet, cells anaerobically grown with phenol contained an enzyme that catalyzed an isotope exchange between [U-14C]phenol and phenylphosphate. This transphosphorylation activity was anaerobically induced by phenol but was stable under aerobic conditions and required Mn2+ and polyethylene glycol. Activity was optimal at pH 5.5 and half-maximal with 0.6 mM Mn2+, 0.2 mM phenylphosphate, and 1 mM phenol. It is proposed that the phenol exchange/transphosphorylation reaction is catalyzed as partial reaction by an inducible phenol phosphorylating enzyme. The isotope exchange demands that a phosphorylated enzyme was formed in the course of the reaction, which might be similar to the phosphotransferase system of sugar transport.', 'The anaerobic metabolism of phenol in the beta-proteobacterium Thauera aromatica proceeds via para-carboxylation of phenol (biological Kolbe-Schmitt carboxylation). In the first step, phenol is converted to phenylphosphate which is then carboxylated to 4-hydroxybenzoate in the second step. Phenylphosphate formation is catalyzed by the novel enzyme phenylphosphate synthase, which was studied. Phenylphosphate synthase consists of three proteins whose genes are located adjacent to each other on the phenol operon and were overproduced in Escherichia coli. The promoter region and operon structure of the phenol gene cluster were investigated. Protein 1 (70 kDa) resembles the central part of classical phosphoenolpyruvate synthase which contains a conserved histidine residue. It catalyzes the exchange of free [(14)C]phenol and the phenol moiety of phenylphosphate but not the phosphorylation of phenol. Phosphorylation of phenol requires protein 1, MgATP, and another protein, protein 2 (40 kDa), which resembles the N-terminal part of phosphoenol pyruvate synthase. Proteins 1 and 2 catalyze the following reaction: phenol + MgATP + H(2)O-->phenylphosphate + MgAMP + orthophosphate. The phosphoryl group in phenylphosphate is derived from the beta-phosphate group of ATP. The free energy of ATP hydrolysis obviously favors the trapping of phenol (K(m), 0.04 mM), even at a low ambient substrate concentration. The reaction is stimulated severalfold by another protein, protein 3 (24 kDa), which contains two cystathionine-beta-synthase domains of unknown function but does not show significant overall similarity to known proteins. The molecular and catalytic features of phenylphosphate synthase resemble those of phosphoenolpyruvate synthase, albeit with interesting modifications.']",

However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus.']",['Substances that prevent infectious agents or organisms from spreading or kill infectious agents in order to prevent the spread of infection.

Blood was taken 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hr after the first dose. Milk was sampled before dosing and 8 hr after dosing. Urine and feces were collected at 24-hr intervals. The goat was killed 50 hr after the first dose (2 hr after the last dose), and the liver, kidney, muscle and fat were removed, weighed and sampled for radioactivity. The plasma concentration peaked at 2.2 ug/mL 50 min after dosing. By 50 hr after the first dose, the highest concentrations were seen in kidney (37 mg/kg), followed by liver (20 mg/kg). Low concentrations were found in fat (1.5 mg/kg) and muscle (0.53 mg/kg). The main route of excretion was urine (49% of the administered dose). Fecal excretion accounted for 10% of the administered dose, and only 0.24% was found in milk. ... Approximately 62% of the administered dose was recovered', 'Six Wistar (Bor:WISW SPF Cpb) rats were dosed orally and one was dosed by intravenous injection with ring-labelled tolylfluanid at 4 mg per rat, corresponding to a dose of 20 mg/kg bw. The rat treated intravenously was killed 5 min after dosing, and those treated orally were killed 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hr after dosing. After oral administration, the radioactivity was absorbed relatively rapidly, as radioactivity was detected in all body tissues except compact bone 2 hr after treatment. The kidney, liver and intestinal tract had markedly higher concentrations than other tissues. After intravenous injection, the pattern was quite different, with high concentrations in all tissues, including fat, probably due to the presence of unchanged parent compound, which is relatively lipophilic. After oral administration, the distribution pattern was that of a hydrophilic substance, with no evidence of storage in a particular organ or tissue. ...The presence of high concentrations in the renal medulla and renal papillary area 2 hr after oral dosing indicated rapid, extensive renal excretion. Rapid fecal excretion also appeared to occur. Over the 24 hr after dosing, the concentrations in tissues and organs decreased rapidly, while depletion was much slower during the subsequent 48 hr. A slightly increased concentration of radioactivity in the infraorbital gland may have indicated some elimination in lachrymal fluid.', 'Groups of BOR: WISW (SPF Cpb) Wistar rats were given phenyl ring-labelled tolylfluanid at 2 mg/kg bw or at 1 mg/kg bw in combination with unlabelled tolylfluanid at 99 mg/kg bw by gavage. Another group of rats received unlabelled tolylfluanid at 2 mg/kg bw per day for 14 days and then a dose of 2 mg/kg bw of radiolabelled tolylfluanid by gavage. The plasma concentration peaked after about 1 h. By 24 h, the plasma 14C concentration had decreased by about 10-fold after 100 mg/kg bw and by about 100-fold after 2 mg/kg bw. The distribution volume in steady state was more than 14 times the body volume, indicating that 14C had been distributed rapidly into peripheral compartments. The short mean residence time in the central compartment of 14 hr indicated rapid redistribution into plasma before excretion. The radioactivity was rapidly excreted, 87-100% of the administered dose being excreted within 48 hr. The main route of excretion was the urine, particularly in females, which excreted < 85% of the administered dose by this route. The tissue concentrations of 14C at 48 hr were low after 100 mg/kg bw. Sex differences were seen in some tissues, with higher concentrations in erythrocytes, kidney, brain and skin in females and higher concentrations in thyroid in males.', 'A dose of 2 or 20 mg/kg bw of 14C-ring-labelled tolylfluanid was given orally to male and female Wistar rats. A further group of rats of each sex was pretreated for 14 days with non-radioactive tolylfluanid at a dose of 2 mg/kg bw before receiving radioactive compound. Tolylfluanid was quickly and almost completely absorbed (> 95%); the peak plasma concentration was reached within 1.5 hr. Within 48 hr, 75-80% of the radioactivity was excreted in urine, 14-25% in feces and 0.06% in expired air. In animals with biliary fistula, biliary secretion accounted for about 14% of the total elimination. Total residual radioactivity represented 0.07-0.2% of the total administered dose. Higher concentrations of radioactivity were found in liver and kidney (three to seven times the mean body concentration), and lower concentrations were found in perirenal fat, brain, gonads and thyroid (three to nine times less than the mean body concentration). Renal clearance was 3.1-4 mL/min, which corresponds to normal renal plasma flow in rats. No effect of dose was observed on pharmacokinetics.', 'Single doses of tolylfluanid labelled with 14C at the fluoridichloromethylsulfenyl group were administered orally to rats. At doses of 0.1-20 mg/kg bw, 50-60% of the administered activity was eliminated in urine and 20-30% in feces within 48 hr. ... In rats with biliary fistula given 0.5 mg/kg bw by intraduodenal administration, about 6% of the total radioactivity was eliminated in bile. When tolylfluanid was administered orally at a dose of 5 mg/kg bw, however, 16% of the activity was exhaled within 48 hr, and the maximal plasma concentration (about 1.5 ppm) was attained after 2 hr. ... Of the administered activity, 6% was retained (excluding gastrointestinal tract) for 8 hr after administration, 2% for 48 hr, 1% for 6 days and 0.5% for 12 days. The highest concentrations were found in the thyroid gland, with 5 ppm 1 day after administration and 1 ppm after 10 days. Whole-body autoradiography after intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg bw confirmed this observation.']","['In a metabolism study in rats, tolylfluanid was administered in single doses of 2 or 100 mg/kg bw, was readily absorbed and rapidly hydrolyzed within 48 hours. Absorption and excretion were independent of dose, sex and pretreatment. About 86-100% of the dose was recovered in 48 hours, with 56-80% of the dose being excreted in urine, 12-36% in the feces, and /about/ 0.48% found in the carcass. Urinary metabolite common to both sexes were dimethylaminosulfonylamino-benzoic acid (RNH 0166; 46-78%), and 4-methylamino-benzoic acid (RNH 0416; 3-6%). Fecal compounds identified were unchanged tolylfluanid (1-19%), dimethylaminosulfotoluidid (DMST; 5-8%), RNH 0166 (3-12%) and RNH 0416 (<1%). The data indicate that tolylfluanid hydrolyzed to DMST, which is then transformed to the major metabolite RNH 0166, which can be further demethylated to the minor metabolite, RNH 0416.', 'Series of metabolism studies showed that metabolic profile /is/ dependent upon label position.

The high chemical reactivity of NEU renders it unlikely that enzymic catalysis is involved in its decomposition.', 'The tissue-disposition and fate of N-[(14)C]ethyl-N-nitrosourea has been studied in mice. A large part of the injected N-[(14)C]ethyl-N-nitrosourea radioactivity was found to be exhaled as (14)CO2. Whole-body autoradiography showed evenly distributed radioactivity in most tissues shortly after the administration of N-[(14)C]ethyl-N-nitrosourea which probably is due to the homogeneously distributed substance and the non-enzymatically formed ethyl-carbonium ions which have reacted with the tissues. The blood-brain barrier seemed to have a capacity to partially prevent the uptake of the substance in the central nervous system. A high radioactivity was observed in the liver, which may imply that N-[(14)C]ethyl-N-nitrosourea is enzymatically decomposed in this tissue. An observed labelling of kidneys may be connected with urinary excretion of radioactivity. The radioactivity in the liver and kidney decreased at later survival intervals and a distribution pattern appeared, which was characterized by a labelling of tissues with a high protein or steroid synthesis and of fat containing tissues. The distribution pattern corresponded to the one seen after the administration of [(14)C]acetaldehyde and is probably due to normal biosynthetic incorporation of radioactivity in the 2-carbon pool. Pretreatments with pyrazole, nialamide and diethyldithiocarbamate caused a marked inhibition of the exhalation of (14)CO2 and of the incorporation of radioactivity in the liver. This effect may be directed towards the decomposition of N-[(14)C]ethyl-N-nitrosourea itself, but an effect on the metabolism of formed 2-carbon fragments is also possible. The incorporation of radioactivity in other tissues was not influenced by the pretreatments.']","['In the ethylation of tRNA from calf liver with (14)C-labeled ENU in vitro, 1,7-diethylguanine was obtained as the main product. ...

The above compounds were used as a sole carbon source for their growth. Using the reversed-phase thin layer chromatography techniques a number of anthracene and 9,10-dimethylanthracene metabolites were isolated and their structures identified spectroscopically.

Bacteria metabolize hydrocarbons using the dioxygenase enzyme system, which differs from the mammalian cytochrome P-450 monoxygenase. ...', 'In-vitro stereoselective metabolism of methylated anthracenes by rat liver microsomes, and the configurations and optical purity of the trans-dihydrodiol metabolites were investigated. Liver microsomes from untreated immature male Sprague-Dawley-rats and from rats pretreated with either 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) or phenobarbital (PB) were incubated with 9-methylanthracene (779022) (9-MA), 9-hydroxymethylanthracene (9-OHMA), or 9,10-dimethylanthracene (781431) (9,10-DMA) for 60 minutes. Metabolites were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results indicated that 9-MA, 9-OHMA and 9,10-DMA were metabolized by 3-MC, PB and control microsomes in a stereoselective manner. With the exception of the formation of 9-OHMA-trans-3,4 dihydrodiol by PB microsomes, all of the trans-dihydrodiol metabolites formed from the three microsomal enzyme systems were predominantly the R,R enantiomers. The 3-MC microsomes exhibited much higher stereoselectivity than the Pb or control microsomes in the formation of trans-dihydrodiols from anthracene, 9-MA, 9-OHMA and 9,10-DMA. Optical purities of the trans-dihydrodiol metabolites, determined by analysis of the chiral stationary phase HPLC profiles of the dihydrodiols or their corresponding tetrahydrodiol derivatives, ranged from 76 to 98 percent, 4 to 76 percent and 4 to 60 percent for 3-MC, PB and control microsomes, respectively. Methyl and hydroxymethyl substituents slightly decreased the stereoselectivity of the trans-dihydrodiol formation. The authors conclude that the lower optical purities of the trans-dihydrodiols formed by either PB or control microsomes are clearly due to the lower stereoselectivity of the cytochrome-P-450 enzymes or epoxidation of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon substrates, but not due to the change of the stereoselectivity of the epoxide hydrolase enzymes.', 'The metabolism of the weakly-carcinogenic hydrocarbon, 9,10-dimethylanthracene (DMA) by rat-liver microsomal preparations has been examined. 9-Hydroxymethyl-10-methylanthracene (9-OHMeMA) and 9,10-dihydroxymethyl-anthracene (9,10-DiOHMeA) were identified as metabolites by comparing their chromatographic and spectral properties with those of the authentic compounds. The trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy derivative of DMA (DMA 1,2-diol) was the major metabolite formed which was identified by its chromatographic, u.v., n.m.r. and mass spectral properties. The dihydrodiol was also formed in the oxidation of DMA in an ascorbic acid-ferrous sulphate-EDTA system. Two other dihydrodiols that were formed from DMA by metabolism appeared to be the trans-1,2- and 3,4-dihydrodiols of 9-OHMeMA (9-OHMeMA 1,2-diol and 9-OHMeMA 3,4-diol) and the further metabolism of DMA 1,2-diol yielded both of these dihydrodiols. When 9-OHMeMA was further metabolized, two main metabolites were formed; one was identified as 9,10-DiOHMeA and the other appeared to be 9-OHMeMA 3,4-diol. No metabolites were detected when 9,10-DiOHMeA was incubated with rat-liver microsomal fractions.']",

Increasing the SHBG levels in women with previous constant plasma d-Ng levels increased these levels two- to sixfold. It is concluded that SHBG is the main carrier protein for d-Ng.

Unbound levonorgestrel concentrations increased from day 1 to days 6 and 21 by 25% and 83%, respectively. The kinetics of total levonorgestrel are nonlinear due to an increase in binding of levonorgestrel to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which is attributed to increased SHBG levels that are induced by the daily administration of ethinyl estradiol.', 'The bioavailability of levonorgestrel is generally accepted to be 100%.

These observations are compared with those reported earlier on the urinary metabolites of dl-norgestrel in women.', 'The in vitro metabolism of stereo-isomers (d, l and the racemic mixture dl) of norgestrel by a microsomal fraction from rabbit liver was investigated. The metabolism of the biologically active l-norgestrel was more rapid than that of d-norgestrel (sic.) which is biologically inactive. This was mainly due to the more ready conversion of l-norgestrel to ring-A reduced metabolites. There was no difference between the two isomers in respect of the amount undergoing hydroxylation; about 40% of each isomer was converted to hydroxylated metabolites after 30 min incubation. However, there were differences between the isomers, l-norgestrel being converted mainly to the 16beta-hydroxysteroid and d-norgestrel to the 16alpha-hydroxysteroid. Similar amounts of both isomers were hydroxylated at C-6. The metabolism of the racemic mixture was intermediate between that of the d and l isomers.', 'The rates of metabolism of synthetic gestagens derived from 19-nortestosterone by rabbit liver tissue in vitro were compared. Over a period of 1 hr norethisterone was metabolized as rapidly as 19-nortestosterone whereas d-norgestrel and lynestrenol were metabolized at a slightly lower rate. Less than 5% of l-norgestrel was metabolized. In all cases the reaction product was the tetrahydrosteroid. Lynestrenol was metabolised through norethisterone. Skeletal muscle, lung and small intestine also metabolized norethisterone and d-norgestrel but at a slower rate than liver tissue. Small amounts of norethisterone were metabolized by adipose tissue but heart and spleen were inactive. Lynestrenol and l-norgestrel were not metabolized by any of the extra-hepatic tissues studied.', 'In vitro studies were conducted on the metabolism of 3 steroids used in OCs (oral contraceptives) by small pieces of human jejunal mucosa. This was done because the gastrointestinal mucosa of humans is known to metabolize a number of drugs. Almost 40% of the ethinyl estradiol, 9.8% of the levonorgestrel, and 7% of the mestranol were metabolized after incubation. All these metabolic responses were significantly different from those in the control groups. Results of the study show that the metabolism of the ethinyl estradiol was related to the weight of the tissue used. These results are consistent with the known marked 1st pass effect of ethinyl estradiol. Norgestrel, known to have little or no 1st pass effect, did not show a high rate of gut metabolism. Under the experimental conditions employed, no Phase 1 metabolism of either ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel was apparent.', 'Following absorption, levonorgestrel is conjugated at the 17beta-OH position to form sulfate conjugates and, to a lesser extent, glucuronide conjugates in plasma. Significant amounts of conjugated and unconjugated 3alpha, 5beta-tetrahydrolevonorgestrel are also present in plasma, along with much smaller amounts of 3alpha, 5alpha-tetrahydrolevonorgestrel and 16beta-hydroxylevonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel and its phase I metabolites are excreted primarily as glucuronide conjugates. Metabolic clearance rates may differ among individuals by several-fold, and this may account in part for the wide variation observed in levonorgestrel concentrations among users.', 'The most important metabolic pathway for levonorgestrel occurs in the reduction of the delta4- and the 3-oxo-group as well as hydroxylations at positions 2alpha , 1beta, and 16beta, followed by conjugation.

Levonorgestrel was found mostly untransformed in serum within 1-2 hr after administration, but the concentrations of conjugated metabolites increased progressively between 4 and 24 hr after ingestion. Most of the conjugates were sulfates and glucuronides. In addition to the remaining unconjugated levonorgestrel, considerable amounts of unconjugated and sulfate-conjugated forms of 3alpha,5beta- tetrahydrolevonorgestrel were found; smaller quantities of conjugated and unconjugated 3alpha,5beta-tetrahydrolevonorgestrel and 16beta-hydroxylevonorgestrel were also identified. ...

Volunteers were exposed, once weekly for 1 hr, first to air and then to ascending concentrations of HFC (1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 parts per million (ppm)), interspersed with a second air exposure and two CFC 12 (dichlorodifluoromethane) exposures (1000 and 4000 ppm). Comparison of either HFC 134a or HFC 227 to CFC 12 or air gave no clinically significant results for any of the measured laboratory parameters. There were no notable adverse events, there was no evidence of effects on the central nervous system, and there were no symptoms of upper respiratory tract irritation. HFC 134a, HFC 227, and CFC 12 blood concentrations increased rapidly and in an exposure-concentration-dependent manner, although not strictly proportionally, and approached steady state. Maximum blood concentrations (C(max)) tended to be higher in males than females. ... In the HFC 134a study, the gender difference in C(max) was only statistically significant (P < 0.05) for CFC 12 at 4000 ppm and HFC 134a at 8000 ppm. Following the end of exposure, blood concentrations declined rapidly, predominantly biphasically and independent of exposure concentration.

Results from these dynamic 19F NMR studies suggest that a steady-state in vivo concentration of HFA-134a was approached at approximately 25 min into the exposure. Quantitative integration analysis using an external standard estimated this plateau to be 58.3 +/- 11.9 mg of absorbed HFA-134a per rat. The HFA-134a 19F NMR signal disappeared rapidly following removal of the test atmosphere, with an elimination half-life of 4.6 +/- 0.6 min in the male rats and 4.9 +/- 1.5 min in the female rats. The data suggest that there was no statistical difference between the sexes in amount absorbed or in elimination half-lives.', 'HFA134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) is a nonozone-depleting candidate to replace the chlorofluorocarbons used as propellants in metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) for pharmaceuticals that are widely used in the treatment of respiratory tract disease. As a means for ensuring the safety of such a compound for human use, it is necessary to establish that there is no excessive or unexpected accumulation in the body and in selected regions. A sensitive whole-body gamma-counting technique has been used with 18F-labeled HFA134a to measure the whole-body and regional absorption, distribution, and retention of HFA134a after administration in humans by single-breath inhalation. In seven healthy subjects, labeled HFA134a was rapidly eliminated by ventilation during the first few minutes, with an average of 9.6% of the radioactivity retained in the body at 5 min. This radioactivity cleared with an apparent terminal half-life of 1.5-4.2 hr to leave, on average, < 1% of the administered dose (< 750 micrograms, approximately 0.2 microCi) retained in the body at 5.8 hr. Disposition of radioactivity was independent of the position of label. Thus, there was no evidence of any significant degradative metabolism. On average, only 0.0056% of the administered dose appeared in the urine within the first 2 hr. Later samples contained no significant radioactivity. Inhaled HFA134a first distributed to all regions of the body and then cleared without evident accumulation in any specific region.', 'The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the chlorine-free propellant HFA134a were assessed in healthy subjects after single and repeat doses.

HFA134a was rapidly absorbed after inhalation with dose-related blood concentrations which declined rapidly after dosing (t1/2 = 31 min). Metabolism was not a significant route of elimination of HFA134a. Studies were also performed with salmeterol and salbutamol MDIs reformulated with HFA134a.

Of the inhaled dose, approx. 1% was recovered in urine, feces and expired air postexposure indicating that absorption of this fluorocarbon across the lung is poor. Of this 1%, approx, two-thirds were exhaled within 1 hr of the cessation of exposure as unchanged HFC134a. The remaining radioactivity was exhaled as [(14)C]-carbon dioxide or excreted in urine and feces as trifluoroacetic acid. Carbon dioxide was the major metabolite of HFC134a accounting for 0.22 and 0.27% of the inhaled dose in the male and female rat, respectively. Urinary excretion accounted for 0.09% of the dose and fecal excretion 0.04% of the dose by both sexes. Total metabolism measured as the sum of the radioactivities in urine, feces and as carbon dioxide amounted to 0.34 and 0.40% of the inhaled dose in male and female, respectively. There were no major sex differences in the rates, routes or amounts of radiolabel excreted. Analysis of a range of tissues at 5 days postexposure showed a relatively uniform distribution of radioactivity. There was no evidence for a specific uptake of HFC134a or a metabolite into any organ or tissue analyzed, including fat.', 'The chlorofluorocarbon substitute 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is subject to metabolism by cytochrome p450 in hepatic microsomes from rat, rabbit, and human. In rat and rabbit, the p450 form 2E1 is a predominant low KM, high rate catalyst of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane biotranformation and is prominently involved in the metabolism of other tetrahaloalkanes of greater toxicity than 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (eg, 1,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoroethane). In this study, it was determined that the human ortholog of p450 2E1 plays a role of similar importance in the metabolism of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane. In human hepatic microsomes from 12 individuals, preparations from subjects with relatively high p450 2E1 levels were shown to metabolize 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane at rates 5- to 10-fold greater than microsomes of individuals with lower levels of this enzyme; the increased rate of metabolism of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane was specifically linked to increased expression of p450 2E1. The primary evidence for the conclusion is drawn from studies using mechanism based inactivation of p450 2E1 by diethyldithiocarbamate, competitive inhibition of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane oxidation by p-nitrophenol (a high affinity substrate for p450 2E1), strong positive correlations of rates of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane defluorination with p-nitrophenol hydroxylation in the study population, and correlation of p450 2E1 levels with rates of halocarbon oxidation. Thus, our findings support the conclusion that human metabolism of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is qualitatively similar to that of the species (rat and rabbit) used for toxicological assessment of this halocarbon. Although hazard from 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane exposure is not anticipated in most humans (based on toxicological evaluation in laboratory animals), our results suggest that 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane exposure should be minimized for individuals with chemical exposure histories commensurate with elevation of p450 2E1 (ie, frequent contact with agents such as ethanol, trichloroethylene, or pyridine). Furthermore, these findings suggest that toxicity assessment of certain other haloethanes currently under consideration as replacements for chlorofluorocarbons should be considered in animals with elevated p450 2E1.', '1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane, which lacks ozone depleting potential, has been selected as a replacement refrigerant for dichlorodifluoromethane in air conditioning and chiller applications, and as a propellant for pharmaceutical aerosols. A variety of paradigms using rats and rabbits have shown that 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane has very little toxic potential. To strengthen the prediction of human hazard associated with 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane exposure, the rate of metabolism of this halocarbon by human hepatic microsomes was evaluated relative to similar tissue preparations derived from rats and rabbits. Human microsomes defluorinated 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane in a cytochrome p450 catalyzed reaction, common also to rat and rabbit. In absolute terms, the maximal rate of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane metabolism by human microsomes was very low, showed little interindividual variation among the samples evaluated (1.3 : 0.3 nmol fluoride ions/mg protein/15 min, x : standard deviation, n = 10), and did not exceed that in rat or rabbit liver microsomes. These findings support the argument that for characterization of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane toxicity, especially that which may be mediated by products of halocarbon metabolism, laboratory animals are an adequate surrogate for humans.', '1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane (R-134a), a nonozone-depleting alternative air-conditioning refrigerant and propellant for pharmaceutical preparations, is oxidatively defluorinated by rat hepatic microsomes. In this report we show that induction of cytochrome P-450IIE1 in rats, by pyridine administration, resulted in an 8-fold increase in the rate of R-134a metabolism by hepatic microsomes (Vmax 47 vs. 6 nmol F-/mg microsomal protein/15 min). Furthermore, when data were normalized for P-450 content, a 4-fold increase in R-134a metabolism was noted for IIE1-enriched microsome preparations. In contrast, phenobarbital and Aroclor 1254 decreased the specific activity of hepatic microsomes for this function. The microsomal content of P-450IIE1, as evaluated by Western blot, was elevated significantly only in microsomes from pyridine-treated rats. p-Nitrophenol and aniline, which are metabolized at high rates by rat P-450IIE1, decreased the rate of R-134a defluorination by hepatic microsomes; Dixon plot analysis indicated competitive inhibition with a Ki of 36 microM p-nitrophenol or 115 microM aniline. Pyridine also potently induced defluorination of R-134a catalyzed by rabbit liver microsomes. Studies with individual P-450 isozymes purified from rabbit liver showed that the phenobarbital- and polycyclic hydrocarbon-induced isozymes (IIB1 and IA2) defluorinated R-134a at negligible rates (1.9 and 0.4 nmol F-/nmol P-450/60 min, respectively). In contrast, P-450IIE1 catalyzed defluorination of R-134a at a relatively high rate (16.2 nmol F-/nmol P-450/60 min); isozyme IA1, which also is induced by nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as pyridine, was somewhat active (5.3 nmol F-/nmol P-450/60 min).', 'The metabolism of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane by hepatocytes was investigated. Liver cells were isolated from male Fischer 344 rats and exposed to atmospheres containing 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane and/or halothane and analyzed for fluoride. Fluoride was detected after exposure of hepatocytes to 25% 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, and the amount increased with the number of cells and with increasing 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane concn. A nonlinear relationship was seen between 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane concn and fluoride, indicating probable substrate saturation.  When hepatocytes were incubated with 25% 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane and halothane, there was a reduction in fluoride production that was related to the concn of halothane. Hepatocytes from phenobarbital treated animals produced as much fluoride as untreated animals in the presence of 12.5% or less 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, however at a concn of 25% or more 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, phenobarbital treated cells produced more fluoride than untreated cells. It was concluded that 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane can be metabolized by liver cells, and may involve cytochrome p450.']","['...

For the oral and intraperitoneal routes of exposure the rats (four animals/dose level/route of exposure) received a single dose of (14)C-HEA at 2.5 or 50 mg/kg bw. For the inhalation exposure, six rats were exposed to a target concentration of 8 ppm (14)C-HEA for six hours in a head only inhalation chamber. For the dermal exposure, four rats were treated with (14)C-HEA at a dose of 50 mg/kg. No qualitative differences in urinary metabolites between routes were observed, indicating no marked route-dependent differences in the metabolic fate of HEA. The results of the study indicate that once the chemical becomes systemically available it is rapidly metabolized and eliminated from the body as either CO2 in the expired air or urinary metabolites with approximately equal percentage of administered/exposed dose eliminated by each route. The half-lives of elimination of radioactivity were approximately 14 hours for urine and 17 hours for CO2. The halflife of elimination of radioactivity from plasma was approximately 26 hours although the label was not associated with parent HEA. The available metabolic data on HEA is consistent with information on studies with other acrylates where hydrolysis of the ester functionality is the primary metabolic pathway. By analogy with ethyl acrylate and acrylic acid, it is expected that a minor metabolic pathway for HEA will be via conjugation with glutathione with the resulting mercapturic acid derivatives being excreted in the urine.', 'The metabolism and excretion of HEA has been examined in male Fischer 344 rat using oral, intraperitoneal, dermal and inhalation routes of exposure ... For the oral and intraperitoneal routes of exposure the rats (4 animals/dose level/route of exposure) received a single dose of 2.5 or 50 mg/kg bw (approx 15-20 uCi). For the inhalation exposure six rats were exposed to a target concentration of 8 ppm (14)C HEA for 6 hours in a head only inhalation chamber. For the dermal exposure 4 rats were treated with (14)C HEA at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg bw. No qualitative differences in urinary metabolites between routes were observed, indicating no marked route-dependent differences in the metabolic fate of HEA. The results of the study indicate that once the chemical becomes systemically available it is rapidly metabolized and eliminated from the body as either CO2 in the expired air or urinary metabolites.

By analogy with ethyl acrylate and acrylic acid it is expected that a minor metabolic pathway for HEA will be via conjugation with glutathione with the resulting mercapturic acid derivatives being excreted in the urine. For the oral and intraperitoneal routes (2.5 mg/kg bw) 35-36% of the administered dose was expired as (14)CO2 and 43-47% of the dose excreted via the urine by 48 hours post-dosing. At 50 mg/kg bw 40-45% of the dose was expired as (14)CO2 and 33-36% of the dose was excreted in the urine.

At this higher dose there was a shift from the urinary pathway as the primary route of elimination to the exhalation of (14)CO2 as the primary route of elimination. As with the 2.5 mg/kg dose, the tissues and carcass accounted for 10-13% of the dose and less than 0.6% of the recovered radioactivity was in the final cage wash, less than 0.1% was recovered as volatile organics in the expired air and less than 2.5% of the dose was recovered in the feces.

In 24 hr, 52% of (14)C from ring labelled ametryne was excreted in urine and 18% in feces, and within 72 hr elimination was almost complete when further 6% had been excreted in urine, 14% in feces, and <2% remained in carcass. After 6 hr, levels of (14)C-ametryne were maximal in organs of absorption, biotransformation, and excretion by the stomach, liver, and kidneys, and also in spleen and lung, but these levels decreased with time although blood levels remained constant for 72 hr.', 'The excretion of ametryn utilizing uniformly labeled compound with (14)C-ametryn in the ring or in the ethyl or isopropyl side chains. Forty eight hours after oral dosing of six male and six female Sprague Dawley rats, 57.6% of the ring labeled activity had been excreted in the urine and 32.1% in the feces (total 89.7% of dose). When the fed compound was labeled in the side chains, however, much of the (14)C was excreted in expired air as carbon dioxide. When the fed compound was labeled in the isopropyl side chain, rats excreted 41.9% of the label in expired air, 20% in the urine, 2% in the feces, and 7% remained in the carcass (total 70.9%) at 48 hours. When the ethyl side chain contained the label, 18.1% of the label was excreted as carbon dioxide, 45% in the urine, 5% in the feces and 9% remained in the carcass (total 77.1% of dose). After 72 hours, total recovery was approximately 88% for both of the side chain labeled compounds.', 'Ring labeled ametryn /was administered/ orally to male and female Sprague Dawley rats and measured distribution of label in tissues at 6, 48 and 72 hours after dosing.

As determined by immunoblotting, the expression level of cytochrome P450 1A2 in the latter cell line was found to be the same as in a previously constructed V79 cell line expressing cytochrome P450 1A2 only. The heterologous expression of NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase in V79 cells resulted in increased sensitivity to quinone-type cytotoxins, eg. duroquinone and menadione, that exert their toxicity primarily through the production of reactive oxygen species during redox cycling. The metabolic properties of the cell line expressing both NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase and cytochrome P450 1A2 were characterized regarding dealkylation and deethylation of 7-alkoxyresorufins and sulfoxidation of the triazine derivatives ametryne and terbutryne, in comparison with the cell line expressing only cytochrome P450 1A2. Increased NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase activity impaired the cytochrome P450 1A2-dependent fluorometric resorufin assay, presumably by conversion of the 8-alkoxyresorufins and resorufin to their one-electron-reduced semiquinoneimine forms. The cytochrome P450 1A2-dependent metabolism of the triazine derivatives ametryne and terbutryne was moderately enhanced by increased NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase activity. Interestingly, with NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase overexpression sulfoxidation was increased 2-3-fold, compared with N-deethylation, with a 1.3-1.9-fold increase. Thus, the level of NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase not only had an influence on cytochrome P450 1A2 activity rates but also affected the relative proportions of metabolites in cytochrome P450 1A2-specific metabolite profiles.', 'Usually metabolized by tolerant plants, & to lesser extent by sensitive plants to nontoxic substances such as hydroxyl or dealkylated derivatives. It appears likely that hydroxy-atrazine is the first metabolite, & that degradation within plants is the major protective mechanism.', '(14)C-labeled ametryn was administered orally to groups of six male and six female Sprague Dawley rats. When the label was in the isopropyl side chain, 41.9% of the label appeared as CO2. When the label was in the ethyl side chain, 18.1% of the label appeared as CO2. This indicated that the side chains were extensively metabolized. When the ring was uniformly labeled with carbon-14 and the compound fed orally to rats, 58% was excreted in the urine but it was not determined whether excretion of the original compound or metabolites had occurred.', '... The participation of P450 and flavin-containing monooxygenase in the sulfoxidation of four sulfur containing pesticides, ametryne; terbutryne, prometryne and methiocarb was investigated using human liver microsomes.

The major amount of label was excreted in the urine within 12 hr and accounted for approximately 75% of the labelled dose. ...', 'This study evaluated the toxicokinetics of N-((14)C)methylpyrrolidone (((14)C)NMP) after intravenous administration (0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 500 mg/kg, in saline solution) or topical application (20 and 40 uL/sq cm; 10 sq  cm, neat) in haired male Sprague-Dawley rats. Whatever the dose, unchanged NMP was intensively distributed into the body with a volume of distribution of 69% of body weight. After this phase, unchanged NMP declined almost linearly with time for 3 to 4 hr after administration and then followed a mono-exponential function (t1/2 = 0.8 hr) for the three lowest doses. The maximal plasma level of 5-hydroxy-N-methylpyrrolidone (5-HNMP), the main metabolite, was reached 4 to 6 hr later for the three lowest doses and 8 to 24 hr later for the highest doses. These findings indicate that the elimination of NMP is governed by a saturable metabolism process. The Michaelis-Menten parameters estimated from plasma levels of unchanged NMP were 2 mM and 3.8 mg/hr, respectively. Between 4 and 10% of the administered doses were excreted in the urine as unchanged NMP. Urinary clearance of NMP (0.03 to 0.07 mL/min) indicates intensive tubular reabsorption. 5-HNMP was the main urinary metabolite and accounted for 42 to 55% of the administered doses. Its maximal urinary excretion occurred between 4 and 6 hr after administration of the three lowest doses and between 8 and 24 hr for the two highest doses. Urinary clearance (0.9 to 1.3 mL/min) was compatible with renal elimination by simple glomerular filtration.', 'Metabolism studies were performed using (14)C and tritium labeled N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone in the rat. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with labeled or unlabeled N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone at 45 mg/kg body weight. Urine, feces, expired air, and bile were collected at various times between drug administration and sacrifice. For pharmacokinetic studies, serial blood samples were analyzed at times between 30 minutes and 6 hours post injection. HPLC of plasma N-methyl-2-pyrrlidinone indicated a rapid distribution phase followed by a slow elimination phase with a half life of approximately 7 hours for the (14)C and 10 hours for the tritium isotope. Urinary excretion accounted for approx 70% of the total dose within 12 hours, and a 2:1 ratio in the administered dose was maintained in the urine. The tissue distribution of the radiolabeled isomers showed similar patterns. The rank order of tissue accumulation from highest to lowest concentration was liver, intestine, testes, stomach, kidneys, lungs, brain, heart, pancreas, and spleen.

There was no conjugation with glucoronic acid or sulfate or either 5-hydroxy-N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone or 2-hydroxy-N-methylsuccinimide. One-third of the orally dosed N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone was not recovered in urine as either N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 5-hydroxy-N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N-methylsuccinimide, or 2-hydroxy-N-methylsuccinimide. The half-lives for 5-hydroxy-N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N-methylsuccinimide, and 2-hydroxy-N-methylsuccinimide in urine were approximately 4, 8, and 17 hr, respectively.', 'A method for determination of N-methylsuccinimide and 2-hydroxy-N-methylsuccinimide in human urine and of N-methylsuccinimide in human plasma was developed.

The method is applicable for analysis of urine and plasma samples from workers exposed to N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.', 'This study described the isolation and identification of the major urinary metabolite of N-methylpyrrolidinone in the male Sprague-Dawley-rat following intravenous administration. The rats were injected via the tail vein with either unlabeled N-methylpyrrolidinone or (14)C labeled N-methylpyrrolidinone at 45 mg/kg. Urine was collected during 0 to 12, 12 to 24, and 24 to 48 hours after dosing and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Thermospray liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was performed on samples purified using high performance liquid chromatography method. The major metabolite correlated with 5-hydroxy-N-methylpyrrolidinone based on thin layer chromatography and mass spectral comparisons with an authentic sample.']",

Addition of a second nitro group results in easier reduction of one of the nitro groups on dinitrobenzenes, since they can be reduced under aerobic conditions by hepatic and erythrocyte enzymes. Bacterial reduction of the dinitrobenzenes is probably not quantitatively important in vivo. The second pathway is replacement of a nitro group by glutathione. The relative importance of this pathway compared to nitro group reduction depends upon the compound. It has not been demonstrated to occur for nitrobenzene.

The compounds produced a variety of metabolites indicative of S-oxidation, N-dealkylation, and side chain C-oxidation. The metabolites were formed by processes showing biphasic kinetics, Michaelis constants for the first and second phases varying from 1.4 to 20 uM and from 54 to 530 uM, respectively. Atrazine, terbuthylazine, ametryne, or terbutryne at 25 uM was incubated with human liver microsomes containing substrates for cytochrome-P4501A2 (CYP1A2), cytochrome-P4502A6, cytochrome-P4502D6, cytochrome-P4502C9, cytochrome-P4502C19, cytochrome-P4502E1, or cytochrome-P4503A4 (CYP3A4) isozymes.

Microsomal preparations containing substrates for CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 showed the best correlation with the rates of metabolism of the S-triazines. Only aNF and furafylline, inhibitors of CYP1A2, inhibited metabolism of the S-triazines. A human liver microsomal preparation with demonstrated high levels of flavin containing monooxygenase (FMO) activity and purified recombinant human FMO-3 were incubated with ametryne and terbutryne. The extent of sulfoxidation of the two compounds was determined. No significant formation of sulfoxide metabolites was detected, indicating that the FMO system was not involved in the metabolism of S- triazines by human liver microsomes.

Air strongly inhibited (greater than 95%) the enzymatic reduction of both azo compounds; a 100% CO atmosphere inhibited amaranth reduction (greater than 90%) but only slightly inhibited sulfonazo III reduction (13%). The addition of 50 microM sulfonazo III to microsomal incubations stimulated oxygen consumption, NADPH oxidation, and adrenochrome formation, whereas 100 microM amaranth did not. The reduction potentials of these two azo compounds were also very different (amaranth, E = -0.620 V; sulfonazo III, E = -0.265 V versus normal hydrogen electrode). The organic mercurial mersalyl converted cytochrome P-450 to cytochrome P-420 (68%) and markedly decreased NADPH-cytochrome P-450(c) reductase activity (97%) in microsomal preparations, presumably by inactivating or destroying functional sulfhydryl groups important for the catalytic activity of these enzymes. GSH was used to restore, and NADP+ to protect, the activities of the monooxygenase components from the effects of mersalyl. The data indicate that inactivation of NADPH-cytochrome P-450(c) reductase inhibits sulfonazo III and amaranth reduction, whereas inactivation of cytochrome P-450 inhibits only amaranth reduction. Furthermore, the reduction of sulfonazo III by purified microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P-450(c) reductase was significantly faster than the rate of reduction of amaranth. These studies demonstrate that two distinct sites of azo reduction exist in the monooxygenase system and that not all azo compounds are reduced by cytochrome P-450.', 'The liver enzyme that reduces azo-linkages plays little part in the metabolism /of rats/, as was shown in experiments in which the amaranth was given by intrasplenic infusion.

More than 50 percent of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in about three hours and approximately 90 percent within about eight hours following an oral dose of 0.5 or 5 mg/kg. Within 48 hours, radio- activity excreted in the urine accounted for 98-99 percent of the administered dose. Feces accounted for 0.5 - 2 percent and exhaled air for about 0.2 percent. Radioactivity remaining in the body was about 61 percent of the administered dose at two hours (about 39 percent having been already excreted at that time), about 1.3 percent at 24 hours, 0.5 percent at 48 hours and 0.2 percent at ten days.

The autoradiography showed uptake of radioactivity in the fetuses and a labeling of fetal nasal, tracheal, and bronchial mucosa exceeded the radioactivity that was present in most other fetal tissues. The metabolizing capacity of these tissues in the 15-day-old fetuses had a high capacity to form (14)C-carbon dioxide (14)CO2 and tissue-bound (14)C from the (14)C-labeled NDBA, while tissues in the 12-day-old fetuses, did not. In infant hamsters, the (14)CO2 and (14)C-tissue-binding in the respiratory tissues were in some instances higher than in the tissues of adult animals.

The overall incidence of transplacentally induced tumors was lower in the F1- than in the P-generation and comparatively longer latencies were also observed in the F1- generation. However, in some groups low incidences were found of tumors which did not occur in the mothers (i.e., nasal cavities: BHP, HBBN; trachea: HBBN; lungs: HPPN, BHP, HBBN; liver: OPN, MPN, BHP, HBBN). Compared to exposure at early gestation, the transplacental carcinogenic effect increased at day 14 of gestation.

Acute oral BHA (50 and 250 mg.kg-1) did not change NDBA omega-oxidation, which was reduced by 35% only when the compound was administered 0.5% in the diet for 3 weeks. BCPN formation from BBN was unaffected by acute and chronic BHA pretreatment. In order to verify whether BHA or its metabolite(s) had a direct effect on NDBA and BBN oxidation, the compound was added to S9 fractions from untreated rats at various concentrations. Only when BHA concentrations were equimolar or in a 10-fold molar excess to the substrate concentration, we observed 30-50% inhibition of BBN formation and a reduced BCPN formation (60-80% of control values), from BBN. Thus, only at very high BHA concentrations could we confirm the inhibition of P-450-dependent mixed function oxidase and alcohol dehydrogenase activities involved in the metabolism of NDBA and BBN.', 'N-Nitrosodi-((1-14)C)butylamine (NDBA) has been shown to undergo a high first-pass metabolism in isolated perfused rat small intestinal segments.

In the present study using vascularly perfused rat small intestinal segments, the high first-pass metabolism of NDBA could be confirmed under near in vivo conditions despite the much higher absorption rate. At the end of the 36 min experimental period 70-80% of the dose have been absorbed via the portal blood as opposed to 1-10% of the dose after 2 h in vitro perfusion. omega-Hydroxylation was again the most important metabolic pathway.

The same 2 major deoxyguanosine adducts were produced in each reaction. They were isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography and characterized by their UV spectra, mass spectra and proton magnetic resonance spectra. On the basis of these spectral data, the structures of the 2 major adducts were assigned as 3-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-8R- hydroxy-6R-methylpyrimido (1,2-a)purine-10(3H)one and 3-(2-deoxy-beta-D-erythro- pentofuranosyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-8S-h-ydroxy-6S-methylpyrimido(1,2,-a)purine- 10(3H)one, in which a new saturated 6-membered ring is formed by reaction at the 1- and N2-positions of deoxyguanosine.

No qualitative species difference was detected in chromatographic profiles of chlorophenols extracted from mouse and rat liver after continuous 2 month administration of hexachlorocyclohexane.

No qualitative difference was observed in the chlorophenols of blood of mice and rats. However, the concentration of 2,6-dichlorophenol was 11.52 ug/ml compared to 1.65 ug/ml in mouse blood. In vitro, 647 pmol/mg/hour 2,4,6-trichlorophenol were formed by rat liver microsomes, compared to 219 pmol/mg/hour by mouse liver microsomes. The authors conclude that hexachlorocyclohexane may be a tumor promoting agent which acts by facilitating the development of latent initiated cells of unknown origin. Differential plasma clearance of 2,6-dichlorophenol may account for species differences in its concentration; however it is unlikely that it plays a major role in the induction of liver tumors in mice.', 'The metabolism of tetrachlorobenzenes was investigated in the squirrel monkey and a comparison made of the interspecies metabolism of such compounds. Three groups of four male monkeys were given orally single doses of one of three tetrachlorobenzene isomers in corn-oil twice per week for 3 weeks. The dose levels for 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene were 100 mg/kg, and the dose level for 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene was 50 mg/kg. Respective levels of fecal excretion at 48 hours were 38, 36, and 18% of the initial doses. No metabolism occurred for 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene in the squirrel monkey. Fecal metabolites of 1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene included 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol (2% of dose), 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol (14%), 2,3,5,6-tetrachlorophenol (9%), and 2,3,5,6-tetrachlorophenyl sulfinic acid (15%). For animals dosed with either 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene or 1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene, the fecal radioactivity demonstrated elimination of at least 50% unchanged compound. Fecal metabolites in monkeys dosed with 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene included 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorophenol (22%), N-acetyl-S-(2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenyl)cysteine (18%), 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenyl sulfinic acid (3%), 2,3,4-trichlorophenyl-methyl sulfide (0.6%), and 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenyl-methyl sulfide (0.2%). Different metabolic pathways were briefly compared for the squirrel monkey, the rat, and the rabbit. The authors conclude that the tetrachlorobenzenes studied are metabolized differently in different species and that different isomers are metabolized by different pathways.', 'After lindane was administered to rats in a single oral dose, the time profile of the degree of conjugation of the main phenolic metabolites was evaluated. In all urine samples 2,3-dichlorophenol, 2,4,5- and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, and 2,3,5,6-tetrachlorophenol were constantly present. 2,3,5,6-Tetrachlorophenol and then 2,4,6-trichlorophenol were the prevalent metabolites in all cases. The degree of conjugation did not correlate with the dissociation constant of individual chlorinated phenols. Phenol conjugation declined with time after administration.']",

In phase one (7 days), all the hens received a CCC-free diet [165 g CP/kg dry matter (DM); 11.58 MJ ME/kg DM]. In phase two (11 days), four levels of 15N-CCC: 0, 5, 50 and 250 ppm were added to the respective diets, while in phase three (7 days), CCC-free feed was again offered. Egg samples were taken and the 15N content of egg yolk and albumin were determined. At the end of phase two, there was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in 15N content in egg yolk from hens fed the 50 and 250 ppm CCC diets and in albumin from hens fed the 250 ppm CCC diet. The estimated 15N-CCC residue was 1.71, 6.64, 28.80 ppm in egg yolk and 1.58, 1.08 and 4.50 ppm in albumin from hens fed 5, 50 and 250 ppm CCC, respectively. The CCC residue, from quantitative analysis ranged from 0.21 to 0.93 and 0.93 to 2.43 ppm in yolk of hens fed 50 and 250 ppm CCC, respectively, whereas a range of 0.40-1.46 ppm, was found in the albumin of hens fed 250 ppm. The difference in measured CCC in yolk and albumin and that estimated from 15N-CCC could have been due to breakdown products of 15N-CCC. Seven days after withdrawal of 15N-CCC, the estimated 15N-CCC residue in egg yolk decreased to 0.43, 2.45 and 15.59 ppm, on 5, 50 and 250 ppm CCC dietary treatments, respectively, and to 2.46 ppm in albumin from hens fed 250 ppm CCC. The higher increase in 15N content could have been due to a higher incorporation of 15N-CCC into yolk than albumin during the process of rapid yolk deposition. This experiment showed that consumed CCC is distributed both into yolk and albumin in a dose dependent manner and that CCC is metabolized in laying hens. However, the level of CCC in the diet which could lead to accumulation of detectable CCC levels in eggs as observed in this study, is much higher than the established maximum residual limits in grains.', 'In mammals, following oral administration, 97% is eliminated within 24 hr, principally as the unchanged substance.']","['An experiment was conducted to evaluate the metabolic products of chlorocholine chloride (CCC) in eggs and meat of laying hens fed a diet containing (15)N-CCC.

Samples of eggs and meat from the laying hens were collected. Egg yolks and albumen were separated. Meat was collected from the breast and femur. The metabolic products of CCC were measured using ion trap electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ion trap-ESI-MS/MS). Determination of CCC or its metabolites in eggs and meat showed that CCC was metabolized to choline.

After a single gastric dose of 4.0 mg/kg trimethyltin chloride (2.4 mg tin/kg) to rats, the blood and brain concn of trimethyltin (expressed as tin) were 39 ug/ml and 1.3 ug/g, respectively, while ... after the 4th weekly dose of 4.0 mg/kg the corresponding concn were 120 ug/ml and 3.5 ug/g. In the marmoset treated with 3.0 mg/kg trimethyltin chloride (1.8 mg tin/g), the brain concn of trimethyltin corresponded to 1.53 ug/g at 24 and 0.74 ug/g at 48 hr, but between 48 and 92 hr there was hardly any loss of tin. ... The brain concn of trimethyltin 48 hr after treatment was the same in the rat and the marmoset, but when concn is corrected for blood content of the brain, the marmoset brain had nearly three times as much trimethyltin as the rat brain.', 'Naive rats injected with lithium chloride at various times following consumption of a novel saccharin solution subsequently avoided the ingestion of saccharin with the degree of the aversion related to the interval between ingestion and lithium chloride administration. Although a similar relationship was also evident in animals which had received a single intragastric administration of trimethyltin chloride 21 days prior to the pairing of saccarin and lithium chloride, the trimethyltin-pretreated subjects receiving delayed injections of lithium chloride displayed weaker taste aversions than those not trimethyltin. This disruption in the acquisition of taste aversions over long delays is consistent with other work suggesting that trimethyltin disrupts tasks involving short-term memory. The utility of the conditioned taste aversion paradigm in detecting and characterizing drug toxicity was discussed.', 'In vitro exposure of PHA-stimulated human lymphocytes to organotin compounds resulted in statistically significant increases in the frequencies of hyperdiploid cells. When taken together with our previous study demonstrating spindle inhibiting effects of the same organotin compounds by an indirect method, the present study strongly indicates that organotin compounds are able to induce aneuploidy, probably by affecting spindle function.', 'This study was designed to extend and confirm previous work to assess the distribution of (14)C labeled trimethyltin to liver, kidney, adrenal and fat. A comparison was also made of the maternal and fetal disposition of (14)C derived from labeled trimethyltin when administered at two different periods of gestation, days 12 and 17, to pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were injected with 7.0 mg/kg trimethyltin chloride. The neuropathology seen following an in utero exposure to trimethyltin was much less severe than that observed after either neonatal or adult exposure to trimethyltin. The fetuses of dams expose on either gestational day 12 or 17 received substantial amounts of radiolabel derived from and in the form of (14)C trimethyltin. Peak radiolabel concentrations in gestational day 12 maternal and fetal brain were only 11 to 30 percent of those levels seen in gestational day 17 animals. Trimethyltin apparently readily crossed the placenta and entered the fetal blood and tissue, including the brain. There was no selective distribution of trimethyltin within the brain such as brainstem versus cerebrum versus cerebellum of the fetus or pup exposed in-utero or within the brain of the maternal rat exposed during gestation.']",,"['The clearance of trimethyltin is slower /than triethyltin/. Brain and blood concn, estimated 1 and 8 days after the last of 4 weekly doses, indicated a very much slower /rate than triethyltin/, approx 16 day clearance half-time. The clearance of trimethyltin in the marmoset was also slow from the brain; but from blood, probably because of the absence of binding to hemoblobin, it cleared with a half-time of 4 days. /Trimethyltin compounds/']"

(See all compounds classified as Hypoglycemic Agents.)'],"['Metformin is slowly and incompletely absorbed from the GI tract, mainly from the small intestine; absorption is complete within 6 hours. The absolute oral bioavailability of the drug under fasting conditions is reported to be approximately 50-60% with metformin hydrochloride doses of 0.5-1.5 g; binding of the drug to the intestinal wall may explain the difference between the amount of drug absorbed (as determined by the urinary and fecal excretion of unchanged drug) and the amount bioavailable in some studies. In single-dose studies with metformin hydrochloride conventional tablets doses of 0.5-1.5 g or 0.85-2.55 g, plasma metformin concentrations did not increase in proportion to increasing doses, suggesting an active saturable absorption process. Similarly, in single-dose studies with an extended-release tablet preparation (Glumetza) at doses of 0.5-2.5 g, plasma metformin concentrations did not increase in proportion to increasing doses. At steady state after administration of a metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet preparation (Glucophage XR), the AUC and peak plasma concentrations were not dose proportional within the range of 0.5-2 g. However, limited data from studies in animals and in human intestinal cell cultures suggest that transepithelial transfer of metformin in the intestine may occur through a passive, nonsaturable mechanism, possibly involving a paracellular route. In several studies with another metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet preparation (Fortamet) using doses of 1-2.5 g, metformin exposure was dose-related.', 'Following oral administration of metformin hydrochloride (0.5-1.5 g) as conventional tablets in healthy individuals or in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, plasma concentrations decline in a triphasic manner. Following multiple-dose administration of metformin hydrochloride (500 mg twice daily for 7-14 days) as conventional tablets in a limited number of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, peak plasma concentrations remained unchanged, but trough drug concentrations were higher than with single-dose administration, suggesting some drug accumulation in a peripheral tissue compartment. No accumulation of metformin appears to occur following repeated oral doses of the drug as extended-release tablets. The principal plasma elimination half-life of metformin averages approximately 6.2 hours; 90% of the drug is cleared within 24 hours in patients with normal renal function. The decline in plasma metformin concentrations is slower after oral than after IV administration of the drug, indicating that elimination is absorption rate-limited. Urinary excretion data and data from whole blood indicate a slower terminal-elimination phase half-life of 8-20 hours (e.g., 17.6 hours)1 suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.', 'Metformin is distributed rapidly in animals and humans into peripheral body tissues and fluids, particularly the GI tract; the drug also appears to distribute slowly into erythrocytes and into a deep tissue compartment (probably GI tissues). The highest tissue concentrations of metformin (at least 10 times the plasma concentration) occur in the GI tract (e.g., esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum), with lower concentrations (twice the plasma concentration) occurring in kidney, liver, and salivary gland tissue. The drug distributes into salivary glands with a half-life of about 9 hours. Metformin concentrations in saliva are tenfold lower than those in plasma and may be responsible for the metallic taste reported in some patients receiving the drug. Any local effect of metformin on glucose absorption in the GI tract may be associated with the relatively high GI concentrations of the drug compared with those in other tissues. It is not known whether metformin crosses the blood-brain barrier or the placenta in humans or if the drug is distributed into human milk; however, in lactating rats, metformin is distributed into breast milk at levels comparable to those in plasma.', 'Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, indicating that tubular secretion is the principal route of metformin elimination. Following a single 850-mg oral dose of metformin hydrochloride, renal clearance averaged 552, 491, or 412 mL/minute in nondiabetic adults, diabetic adults, or healthy geriatric individuals, respectively. Renal impairment results in increased peak plasma concentrations of metformin, a prolonged time to peak plasma concentration, and a decreased volume of distribution. Renal clearance is decreased in patients with renal impairment (as measured by decreases in creatinine clearance) and, apparently because of reduced renal function with age, in geriatric individuals. In geriatric individuals, decreased renal and plasma clearance of metformin also results in increased plasma concentrations of the drug; volume of distribution remains unaffected.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for METFORMIN (12 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']",['Metformin is not metabolized in the liver or GI tract and is not excreted in bile; no metabolites of the drug have been identified in humans.'],"['The principal plasma elimination half-life of metformin averages approximately 6.2 hours ... .', 'The drug distributes into salivary glands with a half-life of about 9 hours.']"

Preexposed and unexposed skin was then dermatomed and placed in flow-through in vitro diffusion cells. Five cells with exposed skin and four cells with unexposed skin were dosed with a mixture of 14 different hydrocarbons (HC) consisting of nonane, decane, undecane, dodecane, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, ethyl benzene, o-xylene, trimethyl benzene (TMB), cyclohexyl benzene (CHB), naphthalene, and dimethyl naphthalene (DMN) in water + ethanol (50:50) as diluent. Another five cells containing only JP-8-exposed skin were dosed solely with diluent in order to determine the skin retention of jet fuel HC. The absorption parameters of flux, diffusivity, and permeability were calculated for the studied HC. The data indicated that there was a two-fold and four-fold increase in absorption of specific aromatic HC like ethyl benzene, o-xylene, and TMB through 1- and 4-d JP-8 preexposed skin, respectively. Similarly, dodecane and tridecane were absorbed more in 4-d than 1-d JP-8 preexposed skin experiments. The absorption of naphthalene and DMN was 1.5 times greater than the controls in both 1- and 4-d preexposures. CHB, naphthalene, and DMN had significant persistent skin retention in 4-d preexposures as compared to 1-d exposures that might leave skin capable of further absorption several days postexposure. The possible mechanism of an increase in HC absorption in fuel preexposed skin may be via lipid extraction from the stratum corneum as indicated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. This study suggests that the preexposure of skin to jet fuel enhances the subsequent in vitro percutaneous absorption of HC, so single-dose absorption data for jet fuel HC from naive skin may not be optimal to predict the toxic potential for repeated exposures. For certain compounds, persistent absorption may occur days after the initial exposure.', 'Dermal penetration and absorption of jet fuels in general, and JP-8 in particular, is not well understood, even though government and industry, worldwide, use over 4.5 billion gallons of JP-8 per year. Exposures to JP-8 can occur from vapor, liquid, or aerosol. Inhalation and dermal exposure are the most prevalent routes. JP-8 may cause irritation during repeated or prolonged exposures, but it is unknown whether systemic toxicity can occur from dermal penetration of fuels. The purpose of this investigation was to measure the penetration and absorption of JP-8 and its major constituents with rat skin, so that the potential for effects with human exposures can be assessed. We used static diffusion cells to measure both the flux of JP-8 and components across the skin and the kinetics of absorption into the skin. Total flux of the hydrocarbon components was 20.3 micrograms/sq cm/hr. Thirteen individual components of JP-8 penetrated into the receptor solution. The fluxes ranged from a high of 51.5 micrograms/sq cm/hr (an additive, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether) to a low of 0.334 micrograms/sq cm/hr (tridecane). Aromatic components penetrated most rapidly. Six components (all aliphatic) were identified in the skin. Concentrations absorbed into the skin at 3.5 hr ranged from 0.055 micrograms per gram skin (tetradecane) to 0.266 micrograms per gram skin (undecane). These results suggest: (1) that JP-8 penetration will not cause systemic toxicity because of low fluxes of all the components; and (2) the absorption of aliphatic components into the skin may be a cause of skin irritation.', 'Rat tissue:air and blood:air partition coefficients (PCs) for octane, nonane, decane, undecane, and dodecane (n-C8 to n-C12 n-alkanes) were determined by vial equilibration. The blood:air PC values for n-C8 to n-C12 were 3.1, 5.8, 8.1, 20.4, and 24.6, respectively. The lipid solubility of n-alkanes increases with carbon length, suggesting that lipid solubility is an important determinant in describing n-alkane blood:air PC values. The muscle:blood, liver: blood, brain:blood, and fat:blood PC values were octane (1.0, 1.9, 1.4, and 247), nonane (0.8, 1.9, 3.8, and 274), decane (0.9, 2.0, 4.8, and 328), undecane (0.7, 1.5, 1.7, and 529), and dodecane (1.2, 1.9, 19.8, and 671), respectively. The tissue:blood PC values were greatest in fat and the least in muscle. The brain:air PC value for undecane was inconsistent with other n-alkane values. Using the measured partition coefficient values of these n-alkanes, linear regression was used to predict tissue (except brain) and blood:air partition coefficient values for larger n-alkanes, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, and heptadecane (n-C13 to n-C17). Good agreement between measured and predicted tissue:air and blood:air partition coefficient values for n-C8 to n-Cl2 offer confidence in the partition coefficient predictions for longer chain n-alkanes.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for n-Undecane (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['Alternative fuels are being considered for civilian and military uses. One of these is S-8, a replacement jet fuel synthesized using the Fischer-Tropsch process, which contains no aromatic compounds and is mainly composed of straight and branched alkanes. Metabolites of S-8 fuel in laboratory animals have not been identified. The goal of this study was to identify metabolic products from exposure to aerosolized S-8 and a designed straight-chain alkane/polyaromatic mixture (decane, undecane, dodecane, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, naphthalene, and 2-methylnaphthalene) in male Fischer 344 rats. Collected blood and tissue samples were analyzed for 70 straight and branched alcohols and ketones ranging from 7 to 15 carbons. No fuel metabolites were observed in the blood, lungs, brain, and fat following S-8 exposure. Metabolites were detected in the liver, urine, and feces. Most of the metabolites were 2- and 3-position alcohols and ketones of prominent hydrocarbons with very few 1- or 4-position metabolites. Following exposure to the alkane mixture, metabolites were observed in the blood, liver, and lungs. Interestingly, heavy metabolites (3-tridecanone, 2-tridecanol, and 2-tetradecanol) were observed only in the lung tissues possibly indicating that metabolism occurred in the lungs. With the exception of these heavy metabolites, the metabolic profiles observed in this study are consistent with previous studies reporting on the metabolism of individual alkanes. Further work is needed to determine the potential metabolic interactions of parent, primary, and secondary metabolites and identify more polar metabolites. Some metabolites may have potential use as biomarkers of exposure to fuels.', 'Metabolism of undecane is likely to occur by hydroxylation to yield the corresponding alcohol.']",

An analysis of bromine in tissues following long term exposure in diets that provided 0.1 mg/kg per day to rats indicated a slight increase in bromine content in liver and adipose tissue at 90 days but no significant increase following 12 months of exposure. A significant increase in the bromine content of adipose, but no other tissues, was observed following a similiar dose of decabromodiphenyl oxide for 2 years but not at lower doses. There was no indication as to whether the failure of decabromodiphenyl oxide to accumulate in tissues was due to lack of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract or rapid metabolism and clearance.', 'Retention of decabromodiphenyl oxide in the brain of neonatal mice /had recently reported/. A single oral dose of 14(C)-labelled decabromodiphenyl oxide (purity >98%) was given on postnatal day 3, 10 or 19 to neonatal NMRI mice. Two litters in each age categories were given 1.5 14(C) MBq/kg body weight. The radioactivity in the brain was determined after 24 hours or 7 days after dosing in each of the two litters from the three different age categories. The results of the study showed that 14(C) was taken up into the brain, but there were differences in the amount of radioactivity found in the different age mice. The mice exposed on postnatal day 3 or 10 had around 4% of the total administered dose of 14(C) in the brain at 24-hours after dosing, whereas only 0.6 % of the total administered dose was found at 24-hours in the brains of mice dosed on postnatal day 19. At day-7 after administration the amount of radioactivity in the brain had increased by around a factor of 2 in the mice exposed on postnatal days 3 or 10, whereas no noticeable change in the amount of radioactivity present had occurred in brains of the mice dosed on postnatal day.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for DECABROMODIPHENYL ETHER (36 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['... The unconjugated phenolic fractions isolated from the feces were examined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Methoxyhydroxylated penta- to heptabrominated diphenyl ethers were identified. ... The methoxy and hydroxy substituents were on the same phenyl ring when both were present. In addition, trace amounts of debrominated metabolites and nonaBDEs were also found in the feces and bile, indicating debromination may have been the first step in decaBDE metabolism. A small proportion of monohydroxylated metabolites was found in tissues and feces, indicating a role for reductive dehalogenation followed by an oxidation step or direct oxidative dehalogenation reactions.', 'About 20% of the decaBDE-derived radioactivity in urine from noncannulated rats was protein bound at 72 hours (compared to >73% not associated with protein). Eighteen percent of the bound material was bound to albumin, a serum protein with the ability to bind (nonspecific protein binding) short chain fatty acids. In cannulated rats, 18.2% of the decaBDE-derived radioactivity was unbound, and all the remaining 68.3% was associated with albumin. Two polar metabolites were noted but not identified. Under the assumption that the bound materials are less polar than the unbound materials, this observation supports the concept that a substantial portion, but not all, of the metabolites in the fecal matter originate from the bile. About 90% of the biliary radiolabel was associated with an unidentified 79-kDa protein, with the percent of bound label decreasing from 94 to 87% in bile samples pooled at 1-24 hours, 24-48 hours, and 48-72 hours. Approximately 17% of the protein-bound biliary radioactivity collected over the first 24 hours was parent compound (and the remainder was unidentified metabolites); no parent compound was detected at 48 and 72 hours. The percent of total bound label in the bile samples also declined over time. None of the label in the bile was found to be unbound.', 'The metabolism of unlabeled decaBDE /was evaluated/ in male rats after gavage or i.v. injection. Blood samples were collected at specific intervals for up to 6 days. Pooled plasma samples from all 6 days were extracted and decaBDE and its metabolites were quantified. Analysis of the pooled samples indicated that the major neutral compound in the plasma was unmodified decaBDE with trace amounts of three nonaBDEs. Thirteen phenolic metabolites were determined in the plasma of both the orally and i.v. dosed rats, but only three phenolic metabolites were present in sufficiently high concentration for further analysis. These metabolites were characterized as a hydroxy-octaBDE, an hydroxy-nonaBDE, and an hydroxy/methoxy hexaBDE. The relative amount of each metabolite recovered was not reported, but the concentration of phenolic radioactivity in the plasma collected 3 and 7 days after oral gavage was four times higher than that of the neutral compounds (i.e., the parent or debrominated decaBDE). The authors indicated that reductive debromination may be the first step in the metabolic pathway of decaBDE, followed by oxidation to form phenolic metabolites. It was also suggested that the hydroxy/methoxy metabolites were probably formed via an arene oxide hydrolyzed to a dihydrodiol and further rearomatized followed by a methylation reaction.', 'DecaBDE metabolism /was studied/ in rats given a single oral dose by gavage. Results indicated that in noncannulated rats about 90% of the dose was excreted in the feces within 3 days after a single oral dose of 14C-labeled decaBDE and the majority of this radioactivity (65%) represented decaBDE metabolites. Measurement of bile radioactivity indicated that close to 10% of the total dose was excreted in the bile during the same period, with almost all of the excreted dose in bile in the form of metabolites. Analysis of radiolabeled materials from tissues of these rats at day 3 after decaBDE administration revealed that 42% of the radioactivity in the liver represented solvent extractable lipid-bound metabolites and 30% was in the form of extractable unconjugated metabolites (4 and 26% of which were hydroxylated and neutral metabolites, respectively). Twenty-seven percent of the radiolabel could not be extracted and was tissue bound. Only 1% of the extractable material was water soluble. A larger percentage (61%) of the radioactivity in the small intestine wall was tissue bound. Lipid-bound metabolites accounted for 7% of the label, water-soluble compounds for 11%, and unbound parent or metabolites for 20%. The percentage of the radiolabel found as water-soluble compounds in the intestinal wall was 10 times greater than the water-soluble metabolites in the liver, providing some support for the hypothesis that oxidative metabolism can occur in the intestinal mucosa. Most of the radioactivity (71-80%) in the lung, adipose tissue, and kidney was unbound parent or metabolites; 15-21% represented lipid-bound metabolites, and 1.5-8% was tissue bound. Formation of adducts was indicative of covalent and/or noncovalent interactions with cellular macromolecules.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for DECABROMODIPHENYL ETHER (19 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['A large percentage of absorbed decabromodiphenyl oxide (DBDPO) appears to be rapidly metabolized in the liver and excreted in the bile with a half-life of <24 hr.', 'Pulmonary clearance was evaluated in rats following a single intratracheal injection of 0 or 20 mg decabromodiphenyl oxide (DBDPO) dust (purity 77.4%) suspended in rat serum. Based on determinations of total bromine content in the lungs 3, 10, 30, 91, and 365 d following exposure, the half-life for elimination of DBDPO from the lungs was estimated to be 150 d.', '...The distribution and elimination half-lives of parent BDE-209 and several debrominated nonhydroxylated metabolites based on assays of plasma, excreta, liver, and carcass over a 21-day period that followed 21 days of dosing with 0.36 ug/day /were modeled/. The BDE-209 data showed the best fit to a biphasic depletion pattern. The distribution half-lives were 1.0 and 1.2 days for liver and plasma, respectively. The elimination half-lives for the same tissues were 20.2 and 75.9 days, respectively. A plasma first order half-life for octaBDE-207 (7.9 days) was twice that of BDE-209 (3.9 days). In the liver, the first order half-life estimates for congeners 208, 191, and 197 (approximately 6 days) were greater than those for 206 and 207 (approximately 1 day). First-order estimates for 207 and 196 were intermediate (4-5 days). These values reflect the behavior of the parent BDE-209 and the debrominated, nonhydroxylated metabolites after absorption, distribution, and excretion but do not reflect the distribution and elimination of the hydroxylated metabolites.', 'Half-lives were determined from the slope of the total concentration-time curve by linear regression. The disposition of decaBDE in male rats after oral dosing was described by a two-compartment model with t1/2 beta and t1/2 gamma values of 6.9 hours and 51 hours, respectively. The results from the i.v. study were consistent with a three-compartment model with half-lives (t1/2 alpha, t1/2 beta, and t1/2 gamma) of 1.6 hours, 12 hours, and 58 hours, respectively. This value is lower than the 15-day half-life for humans.', 'For more Biological Half-Life (Complete) data for DECABROMODIPHENYL ETHER (7 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']"

The study was carried out for 12 healthy volunteers who were divided into two groups. Group I received 58Fe-labeled ferric ammonium citrate (III) (58FeAC) equivalent to 6 mg of iron as a control, and group II received a combination of 500 mg of vitamin C and 58FeAC. A new formula was used to calculate the 58Fe absorption ratio reflecting the pool of iron in the intestinal cells, and the ratio was compared with that obtained from Janghorbani's formula, which has been used as one of the common methods. As a result, the 58Fe absorption ratio in group II was statistically significantly higher than that of group I (34.4 +/- 6.1% vs. 15.0 +/- 5.5%, M +/- SD) using Janghorbani's formula. The similar absorption ratio (34.1 +/- 6.0% vs. 14.8 +/- 5.5%) was also obtained by our new formula. Our results confirmed the previous findings that the availability of iron is stimulated by the supplementation of vitamin C. Both formulae agreed in the absorption of iron, indicating that the endogenous excretion of iron (caused by the desquamated cells) in the intestine does not disguise the iron absorption."", 'The absorption of a commercial brand of small-particle reduced iron was evaluated in 10 normal subjects. For each subject, the hemoglobin incorporation method was used to measure the true absorption of 60 mg of iron from either ferrous sulfate or ferric ammonium citrate. The iron tolerance test (ITT) was also studied for these two compounds and for reduced iron. This procedure consisted of measuring the area under the curve of plasma iron elevations at specified times for 6 hours, or the peak plasma iron, corrected by the plasma iron disappearance rate obtained from measuring plasma iron at specified times for 4 hours after the slow intravenous injection of 0.4 mg of iron as ferric citrate. Only the ITT was used to measure the absorption of 60 mg of reduced iron. Reference dose iron ascorbate absorption was measured in each subject. The absorption of ferric ammonium citrate and reduced iron was expressed as percent of dose and also as absorption percent of that of ferrous sulfate. Mean % geometric ""true absorptions"" were 39.0 for reference dose, 10.4 for FeSO4 and 2.4 for ferric ammonium citrate. The later was 23% that of FeSO4. By ITT the mean geometric % absorptions were 7.9, 3.7 and 3.2 for FeSO4, ferric ammonium citrate and reduced iron respectively, or 47 and 41% of that of FeSO4. We propose that the true absorption of the commercial brand of reduced iron tested was 20% that of FeSO4 based on the relation between the ITT results of reduced iron and the ITT and true absorption values of ferric ammonium citrate in relation to FeSO4.']",,

The gestagen orally given with EE was rapidly absorbed from digestive tracts and distributed in tissues in various levels. Gestagen levels in liver and kidney exceeded that in plasma. About 75% of dosed radioactivity was excreted in feces largely via bile and more than 20% in urine within 72 hr after administration. The gestagen was metabolized extensively to more polar products and their conjugates. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the gestagen given with EE did not alter after repeated administrations for 7 days, but was slightly different from that without EE, possibly due to the estrogen effect. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the estrogen was independent from the gestagen given simultaneously. The distribution of the gestagen given with EE revealed by the whole body autoradiography in normal mice were essentially consistent with the radiometric results in rats and that in the pregnant mice showed that the gestagen in fetus was virtually nil under the present conditions.', 'Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of norethisterone (NE) were studied in 12 women, aged 21-37 years, after oral doses of ethynodiol diacetate (EDA). Plasma NE levels, measured by radioimmunoassay, were used to compare the bioavailability of EDA tablets (Ovulen 50; 1 mg EDA plus .05 mg ethinyl estradiol) with that of a standard oral solution of EDA. The 3 different batches of tablets studied showed different in vitro dissolution rates, 82.6%, 94.6%, and 99% at 3 hours. No marked differences were seen in the bioavailability of the tablet formulations, which were essentially bioequivalent to the solution. Peak plasma NE levels were reached within 4 hours of EDA administration in solution or tablets. Following the peak, NE plasma levels declined in 2 phases, with mean terminal elimination 1/2-lives of 4-6.9 hours. These results have shown that small variations in in vitro dissolution rates do not affect the bioavailability of NE from tablets containing EDA.', 'Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids have been identified in the milk of nursing mothers ...']","['After oral administration, norethisterone acetate and ethynodiol diacetate are rapidly converted to norethisterone by esterases during hepatic first-pass metabolism.', 'On administration of a single oral dose of [4-(14)C]ethynodiol diacetate (0.15 mg/kg) to rhesus monkey, plasma concentration of total 14C peaked after about 4 hr. About 60% of the plasma radioactivity was present as glucuronide conjugates and no unchanged drug was detected. Some 67 +/- 6% (mean +/- S.D.) of the dose of 14C was excreted in 4 days, 50 +/- 6% in urine and 18 +/- 2% in feces. Most of the urinary excretion occurred within 24 hr of dosage. Glucuronide conjugates accounted for 60% of the urinary 14C, and 46% of the fecal 14C was free steroids. Norethisterone and its tetrahydro metabolites were identified in the free, glucuronide and sulphate fractions of plasma and urine. Keto-4,5-dihydronorethisterones and trihydroxy metabolites were identified in the conjugated fractions of urine, and a complex mixture of polar metabolites was detected in feces.', 'All of the 17beta-ethynyl progestins reviewed follow similar metabolic paths.

The metabolites of both compounds circulate predominantly as sulfates. In urine, levonorgestrel metabolites are found primarily in the glucuronide form, whereas norethindrone metabolites are present in approximately equal amounts as sulfates and glucuronides. Of the progestogens structurally related to norethindrone, norethindrone acetate, ethynodiol diacetate, norethindrone enanthate, and perhaps lynestrenol, undergo rapid hydrolysis and are converted to the parent compound and its metabolites. There is no convincing evidence that norethynodrel is converted to norethindrone.

Thus the fetal changes were due to the arsenic, not the gallium. The gallium concentrations in the fetus were greater than in the mother. The increase in the material and fetal gallium tissue concentrations at 75 mg/cu m were not proportional to the increases at 37 mg/cu m.', 'After intratracheal instillation into hamsters of GaAs ..., the compound was absorbed from the lungs in 24 hr.

The slower absorption of GaAs from the lungs may account for the lesser fecal excretion', 'Excretion of arsenic absorbed from GaAs is probably as rapid as that found after inorganic arsenic administration; about 35% of soluble sodium arsenite was excreted within 48 hours in humans. GaAs is absorbed slowly from the lung, so arsenic excretion is expected to continue for several weeks after GaAs exposure. GaAs remaining in the lung is eliminated slowly; a single intratracheal dose of 100 mg/kg was excreted in about 3 months and had a half life in the range of 2 weeks.', 'A dose of 30 mg/kg of GaAs introduced into the lung by intratracheal administration produced enzymatic changes in the body characteristic of soluble arsenic compounds; equivalent changes were observed only when 1000 mg/kg GaAs was given by oral administration. The cumulative absorption of GaAs from the lung as measured by the amount of arsenic found in blood and urine was approximately 10-20% of the administered dose, and this appeared over a period of several days ... . This absorption was fairly constant over the dose range of 10-100 mg/kg ... . After oral administration, the amount absorbed appeared to depend on dose in the range 10-1,000 mg/kg; at 1000 mg/kg, less than 1% was absorbed, but the percentage of the dose absorbed rose to almost 10% at the 10 mg/kg dose. These results are all based on arsenic data because no gallium was detected in either blood or urine. Lung and fecal analyses found more gallium than arsenic, suggesting that gallium was more poorly absorbed from the lung than was arsenic and greater amounts of gallium were cleared from the lung by mucociliary mechanisms and subsequently swallowed.', 'Gallium arsenide administered by oral gavage at single doses of 10, 100, or 1,000 mg/kg to male Fischer rats ... or male Syrian hamsters Yamauchi was only slightly soluble in the gastrointestinal tract and therefore absorption was minimal.

For cadmium chloride, only 9% of the lung burden was cleared rapidly after the last exposure (half-life 1.0 days) and 47%. slowly (half-life 87 days), leaving a residual lung burden of 44%. For cadmium sulfide, 41% of the lung burden was cleared rapidly (half-life 1.4 days) and 40% slowly (half-life 42 days), leaving a final residue 19%. In the cadmium sulfide high-dose group, the retention of cadmium sulfide in the lung was greater than that in the cadmium sulfide low-dose groups, indicating that clearance mechanisms may possibly have been impaired in the high-dose group by too great a lung burden. For both compounds, fecal cadmium was initially high. Renal accumulation of cadmium was substantial for cadmium chloride during the exposure period and continued over the following months until it represented approximately 35% of the total cadmium cleared from the lung. For cadmium sulfide, renal accumulation was only 1% of the amount cleared from the lung. The bioavailability of cadmium from cadmium sulfide is thus poor, the majority being cleared from the lungs and excreted in the feces.

In the first study, we measured the cobalt concentration in the urine of 16 workers exposed to cobalt oxide in a Digital Video Cassette manufacturing plant at the beginning and end of their workshift during 2 working cycles. In the second study, we measured the exposure level to cobalt oxide and the cobalt concentration in urine at the end of the workshift of other 16 workers on 3 out of 5 consecutive work days (Monday, Wednesday and Friday). Four workers among the 16 participated twice. In the first study, the cobalt concentration in the urine increased about 1.5-3 fold during each workshift and then tended to decrease rapidly to the control value before the next workshift. In the second study, we examined the relationship between air and urine concentration using 22 samples after excluding data from workers with dust respirators. Comparing the air and urine concentrations for samples under 30 ug/cu m (n = 20), a significant correlation was found (r = 0.76). These results indicate that most of the inhaled cobalt oxide was excreted rapidly, and a good relationship was found between air and urine concentrations at the end of the workshift when the exposure level was under 30 ug/cu m. Therefore, the cobalt concentration in urine at the end of a workshift can be used as an indicator of one-day exposure to cobalt oxide when the exposure is low level.', 'The 24-hr deposition and clearence in hamsters exposed by inhalation and gavage to CoO showed that 87% was distributed throughout the body form an inhaled dose of 784 ug and 11.3%, form a 5-mg dose by gavage.

The cleaning procedure using Ivory Liquid soap significantly increased skin penetration with a median value of 23.6 ng/cm (25-75th percentiles 12-47.1; Mann-Whitney U test, P = 0.0002), whereas the new experimental cleanser only marginally increased penetration (7.1 ng/cm). Our results indicate that it is necessary to prevent skin contamination from occurring because a short contact can increase skin content and penetration even if quickly followed by washing. This study demonstrated that PbO powder can pass through the skin and that skin decontamination done after 30 minutes of exposure did not decrease skin absorption occurring over 24 hours and stresses the need to prevent skin contamination when using toxic substances.', '14 male volunteers were exposed to a lead oxide aerosol for 23 hr per day at an average concentration of 10.9 ug/cu m for up to 17 weeks. ... The air contribution to the lead blood levels was approx 1.4 ug of lead per 100 mL blood per 1 ug of lead per cu m.', 'Data obtained from a feeding study in rats /showed that/ lead uptake into rat femurs was highly dependent on the chemical form of lead administered. Bioavailability was highest for lead acetate, intermediate for lead oxide, and lowest for lead sulfide and Alaskan mixed ore concentrate. This uptake was linearly related to dose over the range studied.', 'The objective of this study was to determine percutaneous absorption of lead compounds, including lead sulfate, lead oxide, lead powder, and lead stearate. The lead content on the skin surface of 10 lead-battery workers was measured by the method of skin stripping, and urinary lead content of rats was measured with epicutaneous application of four lead compounds: lead sulfate, lead oxide, lead powder, and lead stearate. There were significant amounts of lead on the 9th and 10th skin strippings of the dorsal hand and the back of lead workers. The amount of lead on the dorsal hand was significantly correlated with the amount in the blood (n = 10, r 2 = 0.66, p < 0.05, linear regression). In rats, after lead compounds were applied for 12 days, total lead amount in urine significantly increased to 146.0 + or - 6.4 ng (SD) for lead stearate, 123.1 + or - 7.2 ng for lead sulfate, 115.9 + or - 5.3 ng for lead oxide, 47.8 + or - 6.9 ng for lead powder, and 10.3 ng for the control, which indicated significant skin absorption. It was concluded that significant amounts of inorganic lead compounds can be absorbed through the skin, and skin protection in lead-working or any contaminated environment should be carefully considered.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for Lead(II) Oxide (7 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']",,

Nevertheless, most of the available studies regarding the use of nicoboxil and nonivamide topical analgesics focus specifically on their efficacy and safety in treating acute non-specific low back pain, typically finding the combination analgesic to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated medication for such an indication.']","['Topical applications consisting of the individual active ingredients of nicoboxil and nonivamide at doses considered to be therapeutic are generally not considered readily available commercially. Subsequently, the pharmacodynamics of nicoboxil are considered useful in commercially available combination products largely because they combine with those of nonivamide to offer a synergistic effect from the unique complementary actions of these two agents.  Subsequently, nonivamide is a synthetic capsaicin analog with analgesic properties which are assumed to result from the depletion of Substance P in the peripheral nociceptive C-fibres and A-delta nerve fibers upon repetitive topical application. Resultant stimulation of afferent nerve endings in the skin evidently causes a dilatory effect on the surrounding blood vessels accompanied by an intense, long-lasting sensation of warmth associated with the nonivamide use.  Given the proposed effect of nonivamide, it is believed that nicoboxil is a vitamin of the B complex that possesses vasodilating properties facilitated by prostaglandin. The observed hyperaemic increased blood flow effect of nicoboxil occurs earlier and is described as being more intense than the nonivamide hyperaemic effect. Nicoboxil and nonivamide are consequently generally indicated as a combination product because the pharmacodynamics of nicoboxil are considered useful as a complement to those of nonivamide, and vice versa. In essence, both compounds induce vasodilation by different effects and therefore have complementary abilities inducing increased blood flow, thus hastening the hyperaemic skin reaction.']",,"['Specific investigations on absorption of dermally applied nicoboxil in laboratory animals or target species were not available. Published data for nicotinate esters related to nicoboxil indicated however, that members of this class of compounds are in principle able to penetrate skin [12].

The increasing predominance of the less toxic methylated species, especially dimethylarsinic acid, after 3 or 4 days supports the concept of methylation as a natural detoxification mechanism as part of an overall reduction/methylation sequence involved in the biotransformation of inorganic arsenic by the human body. However, the additional possibility of oxidation of As(III) to As(V) in vivo under extreme immediate postingestion conditions is suggested by initial high urinary As(V), As(III), monomethylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid in both cases probably reflect species dependent differences in rates of direct elimination and reactivity with tissues as well as the efficiency of methylation.', 'Rat liver cytosol inactivates inorganic arsenic through methylation; S-adenosylmethionine is the methyl group donor and reduced glutathione is required for full activity. ...

The dimethylated metabolite gives rise to dimethylarsinic acid.

Therefore, after oral administration of a dose of 100 mg of glycyrrhizic acid, this major metabolite appears in plasma in a concentration of 200 ng/ml while glycyrrhizic acid cannot be found. The finding of a minimal amount of glycyrrhizic acid in urine suggests the existence of a partial absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.', 'Glycyrrhizic acid presents a biphasic elimination from the central compartment with a dose-dependent second elimination phase. The majority of the administered dose is eliminated by the bile in which glycyrrhizic acid can be eliminated unchanged and undergoes enterohepatic cycling. On the other hand, the major metabolite, glycyrrhetinic acid, forms glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. These conjugates are efficiently transported into the bile and duodenum where commensal bacteria hydrolizes the conjugate for the formation of glycyrrhetinic acid and further reabsorption.  This reabsorption behavior seems to be related to the activity of 3-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase which transports very efficiently the metabolite from the plasma to the bile.  About 1.1-2.5% of the administered dose of glycyrrhizic acid can be found in urine which corresponds to the minimal cycling and reabsorption of this compound.', 'The apparent volume of distribution of glycyrrhizic acid either in the central compartment and in steady-state are in the range of 37-64 ml/kg and 59-98 ml/kg, respectively.', 'The constant reabsorption of glycyrrhetic acid in the duodenum causes a delay in the terminal plasma clearance.

From plasma and tissues, glycyrrhizic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid are extracted by organic solvents and the extracts can directly be used for HPLC. From bile or urine, extraction and determination of glycyrrhizic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid are more difficult due to interfering endogenous compounds and conjugation of glycyrrhetinic acid with glucuronides or sulfates. Extraction of glycyrrhizic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid from urine or bile can be performed by ion-pairing followed by extraction with organic solvents or by solid phase extraction. Glycyrrhetinic acid conjugates can be determined by chromatographic separation or by pretreatment with beta-glucuronidase. The pharmacokinetics of glycyrrhetinic acid and glycyrrhizic acid can be described by a biphasic elimination from the central compartment with a dose-dependent second elimination phase. Depending on the dose, the second elimination phase in humans has a half-life of 3.5 hours for glycyrrhizic acid and between 10-30 hours for glycyrrhetinic acid. The major part of both glycyrrhetinic acid or glycyrrhizic acid is eliminated by the bile. While glycyrrhizic acid can be eliminated unmetabolized and undergoes enterohepatic cycling, Glycyrrhetinic acid is conjugated to glycyrrhetinic acid glucuronide or sulfate prior to biliary excretion. Orally administered glycyrrhizic acid is almost completely hydrolyzed by intestinal bacteria and reaches the systemic circulation as glycyrrhetinic acid.', 'Glycyrrhizic acid is currently of clinical interest for treatment of chronic hepatitis. It is also applied as a sweetener in food products and chewing tobacco. In some highly exposed subgroups of the population, serious side effects such as hypertension and electrolyte disturbances have been reported. In order to analyze the health risks of exposure to this compound, the kinetics of glycyrrhizic acid and its active metabolites were evaluated quantitatively. Glycyrrhizic acid and its metabolites are subject to complex kinetic processes, including enterohepatic cycling and presystemic metabolism. In humans, detailed information on these processes is often difficult to obtain. Therefore, a model was developed that describes the systemic and gastrointestinal tract kinetics of glycyrrhizic acid and its active metabolite glycyrrhetic acid in rats. Due to the physiologically based structure of the model, data from earlier in vitro and in vivo studies on absorption, enterohepatic cycling, and presystemic metabolism could be incorporated directly. The model demonstrates that glycyrrhizic acid and metabolites are transported efficiently from plasma to the bile, possibly by the hepatic transfer protein 3-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Bacterial hydrolysis of the biliary excreted metabolites following reuptake of glycyrrhetic acid causes the observed delay in the terminal plasma clearance of glycyrrhetic acid. These mechanistic findings, derived from analysis of experimental data through physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling, can eventually be used for a quantitative health risk assessment of human exposure to glycyrrhizic acid containing products.

Indocyanine green did not affect the biliary excretion of glycyrrhizic acid, whereas dibromosulfophthalein reduced it significantly. The plasma level of glycyrrhizic acid was increased by dibromosulfophthalein, but not by indocyanine green. In Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats, the biliary excretion of glycyrrhizic acid was severely impaired, resulting in an increased plasma level. The findings suggested that the biliary excretion of glycyrrhizic acid is mediated by the system shared by liquiritigenin glucuronides and dibromosulfophthalein, but not by indocyanine green, and that the system is hereditarily defective in Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats.']","['When orally administered, glycyrrhizic acid is almost completely hydrolyzed by intestinal bacteria for the formation of glycyrrhetinic acid, which is an active metabolite and can enter systemic circulation, and two molecules of glucuronic acid.

The metabolic pathway is followed by five cycles of β-oxidation. The β-oxidation cycles function by shortening the side chains, the first cycle results in the formation of carboxydimethyldecylhydroxychromanol followed by carboxymethyloctylhydroxychromanol.

Organs and body fluids were obtained at 3, 6, 9 and 12 hr, and 1 and 2 days later, and subjected to speciation analysis. The main characteristics of the metabolism were as follows; MeSeCys was incorporated into selenoprotein P slightly more than or at a comparable level to that of SeMet but less than that of selenite. MeSeCys and SeMet but not selenite was taken up by organs in their intact forms. MeSeCys and SeMet were delivered specifically to the pancreas and present in a form bound to an identical or similar protein.

Metabolites of the labeled (76)Se and (77)Se and interaction with endogenous selenium were traced and examined without interference from the corresponding endogenous natural abundance isotopes.

The second reserve pool is the selenium found in liver glutathione peroxidase. Ingested selenite, selenate, and selenocysteine are all metabolized directly to selenide, the reduced form of selenium.

The major species in background urine were two selenosugars, namely methyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-1-seleno-beta-D-galactopyranoside (selenosugar 1) and its deacylated analog methyl-2-amino-2-deoxy-1-seleno-beta-D-galactopyranoside (selenosugar 3). Selenium was rapidly excreted after ingestion of the selenium compounds: the peak concentrations (approximately 250-400 ug Se/L, normalized concentrations) were recorded within 5-9 hours, and concentrations had returned to close to background levels within 48 hours, by which time 25-40% of the ingested selenium, depending on the species ingested, had been accounted for in the urine. In all experiments, the major metabolite was selenosugar 1, constituting either approximately 80% of the total selenium excreted over the first 24 hours after ingestion of selenite or L-selenomethionine or approximately 65% after ingestion of DL-selenomethionine. Selenite was not present at significant levels (<1 ug Se/L) in any of the samples; selenomethionine was present in only trace amounts (approximately 1 ug/L, equivalent to less than 0.5% of the total Se) following ingestion of L-selenomethionine, but it constituted about 20% of the excreted selenium (first 24 hours) after ingestion of DL-selenomethionine, presumably because the D form was not efficiently metabolized. Trimethylselenonium ion, a commonly reported urine metabolite, could not be detected (<1 ug/L) in the urine samples after ingestion of selenite or selenomethionine. Cytotoxicity studies on selenosugar 1 and its glucosamine isomer (selenosugar 2, methyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-1-seleno-beta-D-glucosopyranoside) were performed with HepG2 cells derived from human hepatocarcinoma, and these showed that both compounds had low toxicity (about 1000-fold less toxic than sodium selenite). The results support earlier studies showing that selenosugar 1 is the major urinary metabolite after increased selenium intake, and they suggest that previously accepted pathways for human metabolism of selenium involving trimethylselenonium ion as the excretionary end product may need to be re-evaluated.', 'When selenium is consumed as selenomethionine or other organic forms that occur naturally in foods, it is released as selenite by postabsorptive catabolism.', 'A major source of selenium in the diet is selenomethionine. Once ingested by an animal, it enters the methionine pool and is not distinguished from methionine. Thus, much of the selenium in animal tissues is selenomethionine that is non-specifically incorporated in proteins at methionine positions. When selenomethionine is catabolized, its selenium becomes available to the selenium metabolic.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for SELENIUM METHIONINE (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['The long term fate of an oral dose of (75)Se selenomethionine has been studied in 4 women. Intestinal absorption amounted to 95-97% of the dose, the first 2-wk urinary excretion accounted for 6-9% & after 8 wk, the whole body retention of (75)Se decreased exponentially with a half life of 207-290 days. ... (75)Se selenomethionine was found to be more completely absorbed and had a greater body retention of (75)Se with smaller urinary and fecal losses than (75)Se from (75)Se selenite.', 'The half life of selenium methionine is 234 days.']"

The main product, an orange compound with a maximal absorbance at 455 nm, was probably 4,4' dichloroazobenzene. The optimum pH of the reaction was 4. Michaelis constants, determined as described by Dalziel, were 21 mM for 4 chloroaniline and 94 uM for hydrogen peroxide. Syringaldazine was an uncompetitive inhibitor of 4 chloroaniline peroxidation (Ki = 46 uM) and modified the progress of the reaction with the appearance of a lag period. By contrast, 4 chloroaniline was a non competitive inhibitor of syringaldazine peroxidation with a Ki value of 21 mmx at pH 7.5. Therefore, these two inhibiting effects were compatible with the presence of two binding sites for two different hydrogen donors. Both sites were linked by allosteric interactions.

Intragenic polymorphism of the p53 gene among parental strains enabled us to assess allele loss of the p53 gene and also to determine parental origin of mutated and/or lost alleles. Allele loss was detected in two of 163 tumors heterozygous for the p53 gene. Polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of p53 exons 5-8 revealed 33 mutations in 20 of 182 colon tumors, the incidence being lower than that in human colon cancers. The majority of these mutations were of transition type: G:A transitions at nonCpG sites were most prevalent, while those at CpG sites were less common. Distribution of the mutations along p53 amino acid sequence revealed a difference in the location of 'hot spots' between mice and humans. Incidence of p53 alterations did not differ among alleles of different parental origins, suggesting that genetic changes in 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced mouse colon tumors had occurred independently of parental origin and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine susceptibility. Detailed analysis of p53 mutations on each allele revealed intratumoral heterogenelty in mouse colon tumors. The low incidence of p53 mutations and rare allele loss suggest that p53 alteration plays only a minor role in colon tumorigenesis in mice.""]",,

Because the gerbil was used as model in pharmacodynamic studies, the pharmacokinetic drug disposition was determined in this species and compared to parameters reported in the literature for other species. The terminal half-life is about 1 hour, the apparent volume of distribution 2.9 L/kg, and the total clearance is about 33.3 mL/min/kg. The parameters are comparable to other species including man.

Low uptake, high post-exposure exhalation, and low blood clearance indicate slow metabolism of MTBE relative to many other solvents. A low recovery of TBA in urine (below 1% of uptake) indicates further metabolism of TBA. The concentration of MTBE and TBA in blood was proportional to exposure level suggesting linear kinetics up to 50 ppm.

The metabolism of (14)C-MTBE has been studied in Fischer 344 rats exposed by the inhalation, oral, dermal, and intravenous routes. Respiratory and urinary metabolites were generally similar following exposure of Fischer 344 rats by all routes, indicating pathways are not route-dependent. After exposure by all routes, most of the exhaled radioactivity was due to unchanged MTBE and tert-butanol, with MTBE predominating. Only a small amount of (14)C-carbon dioxide was detected. MTBE and tert-butanol were generally not found in the urine, but four urinary metabolites were isolated, with two identified as alpha-hydroxyisobutyric acid and 2-methyl-1,2-propanediol. The two other metabolites remained unidentified. After inhalation and oral exposure, there was a larger fraction of exhaled tert-butanol in low dose rats than in high dose rats. In inhalation experiments, rats were exposed to (14)C-MTBE at 400 or 8000 ppm for 6 hr or to 400 ppm unlabeled MTBE for 6 hr per day for 14 days, then to 400 ppm (14)C-MTBE on day 15. tert-Butanol accounted for 25 and 30% of the recovered radioactivity in expired air at 3 hr after the single and repeated low exposure concentration, respectively. Exposure to the higher concentration for 6 hr resulted in a lower fraction recovered (7-10%) as a result of to tert-butanol. At 3-6 hr after exposure, tert-butanol represented 72-80% of the radioactivity at the low dose in the single and repeated exposure experiments and 43-54% at the high dose.  Results of dosing Fischer 344 rats with (14)C-MTBE intravenously were similar to those obtained by the inhalation, oral and dermal routes. In Charles River CD (Sprague-Dawley) rats injected with a single intraperitoneal dose of 232 mg/kg (14)C-MTBE, blood, tissue, expired air, urine, and feces were sampled at various times up to 48 hr. At 6 hr about 92% of the radioactive dose was eliminated in expired air, 99.1% of which was unchanged MTBE. An average of 7.38% of the administered dose was expired as radiolabeled carbon dioxide. Analysis of the urine revealed that radiolabeled formic acid accounted for 96.6% of the urinary radioactivity. The remaining radioactivity in the urine was assumed to be radiolabeled methanol and formaldehyde. Methanol and formic acid were also detected in plasma, kidney, and liver. No tert-butanol was found in the urine. The metabolism of MTBE to formaldehyde was studied using liver microsomes from control and phenobarbital-pretreated rats (strain not specified). Phenobarbital pretreatment approximately doubled the formation of formaldehyde from MTBE. Further metabolism of formaldehyde yields methanol and/or formic acid; the probable enzymes and cofactors are alcohol dehydrogenase and NADH for the formation of methanol and aldehyde dehydrogenase and NAD for the formation of formic acid.', 'Exposure to methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) previously /has/ been shown to alter various muscle, kidney, and liver metabolic activities. In the present study, the metabolism of MTBE by liver microsomes from acetone- or phenobarbital-treated Sprague-Dawley rats was studied at concn of up to 5 mM MTBE. Equimolar amounts of tertiary- butanol, as measured by head-space gas chromatography, and formaldehyde were formed. The Vmax for the demethylation increased by 4 fold and 5.5 fold after acetone and phenobarbital treatments, respectively. The apparent Km value of 0.70 mM using control microsomes was decreased slightly after acetone treatment, but was increased by 2 fold after phenobarbital treatment. The metabolism of MTBE (1 mM) was inhibited by 35% by monoclonal antibodies against p450IIE1, the acetone/ethanol inducible form of cytochrome p450, suggesting a partial contribution by this isozyme. A single 18 hr pretreatment of rats with 1 or 5 mL/kg MTBE (ip) resulted in a 50 fold induction of liver microsomal pentoxyresorufin dealkylase activity but no change in N-nitrosodimethylamine demethylase activity. These trends in activity agreed with immunoblot analysis which showed an elevation in p450IIB1 but no change in p450IIE1 level.', '/The/ human liver is active in the oxidative metabolism of ETBE and TAME. A large interindividual variation in metabolizing these gasoline ethers was observed in 15 human liver microsomal samples. The microsomal activities in metabolizing methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) were highly correlated among each other (r, 0.91-0.96), suggesting that these ethers are metabolized by the same enzyme(s). Correlation analysis of the ether-metabolizing activities with individual CYP enzyme activities in the liver microsomes showed that the highest degree of correlation was with human CYP2A6 (r, 0.90-0.95) ... CYP2A6 displayed the highest turnover number in metabolizing gasoline ethers among a battery of human CYP enzymes expressed in human B-lymphoblastoid cells. Kinetic studies on MTBE metabolism with three human liver microsomes exhibited apparent Km values that ranged from 28 to 89 uM and the V(max) values from 215 to 783 pmol/min/mg, with similar catalytic efficiency values (7.7 to 8.8 uL/min/mg protein). Metabolism of MTBE, ETBE, and TAME by human liver microsomes was inhibited by coumarin, a known substrate of human CYP2A6, in a concentration-dependent manner.

Malathion was present in all samples except liver. The highest concn were found in the gastric content (8621 ppm) and adipose tissue (76.4 ppm). Malaoxon was identified in some tissues at very low levels; a significant amt was found only in fat (8.2 ppm). The MCA and DCA were detected in all tissues. The former was found in greater abundance: 221 ppm in bile, 106 ppm in kidney, and 103 ppm in the gastric content.', 'The fate of malaoxon was studied in a susceptible and a resistant strain of housefly following topical application. Sublethal doses were used: 160 pmol for the S-strain (0.17 times LD50) and 1570 pmol for the R-strain (0.1 times LD50). The penetration rates are dose dependent and semilog plots of the external amt versus time show that these rates are not proportional to this external amt. Internal concn of malaoxon rapidly increase following administration, reach max values between 30 min and 2 hr (depending on dose), and then slowly decrease. The rate of metabolic degradation is highest in the early stage of the intoxication process. A 3 compartment pharmacokinetic model is postulated to explain the experimental data quantitatively. The 1st compartment represents external malaoxon, the other 2 represent internal parent cmpd. Statistical analysis shows that the penetration rate is better described with a sum of 2 exponentials rather than with a single exponential decay. In the model, degradation occurs in the 1st internal compartment and is assumed to be 1st order. Malaoxon is distributed between the 2 internal compartments slowly with 1st order kinetics. Parameter estimations with curve fitting procedures for the internal processes (degradation and exchange) shows that there is not one set of parameter values that can be used for both strains simultaneously. Interstrain differences in degradation capacity studies showed that in vitro the R-strain had a 4-fold higher oxidative breakdown rate.

Formation & excretion of chlorodifluoroacetic acid were incr after repeated injection of the animals with HCFC 132b. In vitro experiments using rat liver microsomes suggested the involvement of cytochrome P-450 IIEI in the initial hydroxylation step. No evidence for covalent binding of fluorinated metabolites to liver proteins has been observed.', 'The chlorofluorocarbon substitute 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFC-134a) is subject to metabolism by cytochrome p450 in hepatic microsomes from rat, rabbit, and human. In rat and rabbit, the p450 form 2E1 is a predominant low-KM, high-rate catalyst of HFC-134a biotranformation and is prominently involved in the metabolism of other tetrahaloalkanes of greater toxicity than HFC-134a (e.g. 1,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoroethane (HCFC-132b)). In this study, we determined that the human ortholog of p450 2E1 plays a role of similar importance in the metabolism of HFC-134a. In human hepatic microsomes from 12 individuals, preparations from subjects with relatively high p450 2E1 levels were shown to metabolize HFC-134a at rates 5- to 10-fold greater than microsomes of individuals with lower levels of this enzyme; the increased rate of metabolism of HFC-134a was specifically linked to increased expression of p450 2E1. The primary evidence for the conclusion is drawn from studies using mechanism-based inactivation of p450 2E1 by diethyldithiocarbamate, competitive inhibition of HFC-134a oxidation by p-nitrophenol (a high-affinity substrate for p450 2E1), strong positive correlations of rates of HFC-134a defluorination with p-nitrophenol hydroxylation in the study population, and correlation of p450 2E1 levels with rates of halocarbon oxidation. Thus, our findings support the conclusion that human metabolism of HFC-134a is qualitatively similar to that of the species (rat and rabbit) used for toxicological assessment of this halocarbon. Although hazard from HFC-134a exposure is not anticipated in most humans (based on toxicological evaluation in laboratory animals), our results suggest that HFC-134a exposure should be minimized for individuals with chemical exposure histories commensurate with elevation of p450 2E1 (i.e. frequent contact with agents such as ethanol, trichloroethylene, or pyridine). Furthermore, these findings suggest that toxicity assessment of certain other haloethanes currently under consideration as replacements for chlorofluorocarbons should be considered in animals with elevated p450 2E1.', '1-Fluoro-1,1,2-trichloroethane (HCFC-131a), 1,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoroethane (HCFC-132b), and 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-chloroethane (HCFC-133a) were chosen as models for comparative metabolism studies on 1,1,1,2-tetrahaloethanes, which are under consideration as replacements for ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

Urine collected in the first 24 hr after exposure was analyzed by 19F NMR and GC/MS and with a fluoride-selective ion electrode for the formation of fluorine-containing metabolites. Metabolites of 1-fluoro-1,1,2-trichloroethane included 2,2-dichloro-2-fluoroethyl glucuronide, 2,2-dichloro-2-fluoroethyl sulfate, dichlorofluoroacetic acid, and inorganic fluoride. Metabolites of 1,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoroethane were characterized as 2-chloro-2,2-difluoroethyl glucuronide, 2-chloro-2,2-difluoroethyl sulfate, chlorodifluoroacetic acid, chlorodifluoroacetaldehyde hydrate, chlorodifluoroacetaldehyde-urea adduct, and inorganic fluoride. 1,1,1-Trifluoro-2-chloroethane was metabolized to 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl glucuronide, trifluoroacetic acid, trifluoroacetaldehyde hydrate, trifluoroacetaldehyde-urea adduct, inorganic fluoride, and a minor, unidentified metabolite. With 1-Fluoro-1,1,2-trichloroethane and 1,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoroethane, glucuronide conjugates of 2,2,2-trihaloethanols were the major urinary metabolites, whereas with 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-chloroethane, a trifluoroacetaldehyde-urea adduct was the major urinary metabolite. Analysis of metabolite distribution in vivo indicated that aldehydic metabolites increased as fluorine substitution increased in the order 1-Fluoro-1,1,2-trichloroethane < 1,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoroethane < 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-chloroethane. With NADPH-fortified rat liver microsomes, 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-chloroethane and 1,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoroethane were biotransformed to trifluoroacetaldehyde and chlorodifluoroacetaldehyde, respectively, whereas 1-Fluoro-1,1,2-trichloroethane was converted to dichlorofluoroacetic acid. No covalently bound metabolites of 1-Fluoro-1,1,2-trichloroethane and 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-chloroethane metabolites were detected by 19F NMR spectroscopy. The nature of the identified organic fluorine-containing metabolites indicates that cytochrome p450-dependent oxidation predominates in the metabolism of these 1,1,1,2-tetrahaloethanes. The generation of fluoride from the fluorodihalomethyl group (-CFX2) apparently arises from a separate dehalogenation pathway.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for 1,2-DICHLORO-1,1-DIFLUOROETHANE (7 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']",

On these models, digoxin (DG3) and digoxigenin bisdigitoxoside (DG2) were not shown to be significantly metabolized in vitro ... Therefore, it appeared that the stepwise cleavage of DG3 and DG2 sugars was not cytochrome P450 dependent. This enzymatic system probably plays a minor role in humans for this particular reaction. However, digoxigenin monodigitoxoside (DG1) and digoxigenin (DG0) which are known to be formed after intra-gastric hydrolysis of DG3, were extensively converted to polar compounds (mainly glucuronides). In addition, using human liver microsomes, a wide variability in UDP-glucuronyl transferase (UDPGT) activities responsible for DG1 glucuronidation was demonstrated. These results suggest that two main factors may contribute to the overall interindividual variability of digoxin biotransformation: 1), the individual intra-gastric pH which influences the sugar cleavage leading to DG1 and DG0; ii), a variability in the level of the hepatic UDPGT specific for digitalis compounds conjugation.', 'Digoxigenin (I) biotransformation was investigated in 2 healthy men following ingestion of labeled (7.5 ug) and unlabeled (3 mg) I. Of the radioactivity in serum at 30 min, <26% chromatographed with I; the rest chromatographed as metabolites, most of which were polar. The main polar metabolites identified were glucuronides of 3-epidigoxigenin. There was extensive cross reactivity between metabolites and antisera to digoxin.', 'The sequential metabolism of digoxin (Dg3) to digoxigenin bis-digitoxoside (Dg2), digoxigenin mono-digitoxoside (Dg1) and digoxigenin (Dg0) was investigated in rat liver microsomes. Kinetic studies produced results consistent with a single enzyme mechanism describing the successive oxidative cleavages. Formation of Dg2 was catalysed with mean (+/-SD) Km and Vmax of 125 +/- 22 uM and 362 +/- 37 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. The corresponding values for the formation of Dg1 were 61 +/- 5 microM and 7 +/-1 pmol/min/mg protein. Dg0 formation was catalysed with the apparent values of 30 +/- 9 uM and 310 +/- 30 pmol/min/mg protein. Chemical inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A subfamily with ketoconazole and triacetyoleandomycin decreased the formation of Dg2 and Dg1 by up to 90%. Antibodies specific to rat CYP3A2 lowered the rate of oxidative cleavage of Dg3 and Dg2 by up to 85%. Inhibition of CYP2E1, CYP2C subfamily and CYP1A2 by chemical and immuno-inhibition did not affect initial rates of metabolism of Dg3 and Dg2. In contrast, Dg1 metab was not affected by triacetyloleandomycin as well as by antibodies to CYP3A2, CYP2C11, CYP2E1, CYP2B1/2B2 and CYP1A2. It was however inhibited by >80% by gestodene and 17alpha-ethynylestradiol (selective inhibitors of human CYP3A). Collectively, these data support the involvement of CYP3A in the cleavage of Dg3 and Dg2 in rat liver microsomes. The enzyme-metabolizing Dg1 remains to be identified.', 'Human liver alcohol dehydrogenase (alcohol: NAD"" oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.1) catalyzes the oxidation of the 3 beta-OH group of digitoxigenin, digoxigenin, and gitoxigenin to their 3-keto derivatives. Human liver alcohol dehydrogenase is the NAD(H)-dependent liver enzyme specific for the free hydroxyl group at C3 of the cardiac genins; this hydroxyl is the critical site of the genins\' enzymatic oxidation and concomitant pharmacological inactivation in humans. Several kinetic approaches have demonstrated that ethanol and the pharmacologically active components of the digitalis glycosides are oxidized with closely similar kcat/Km values at the same site on human liver alcohol dehydrogenase, for which they compete. Human liver alcohol dehydrogenase thereby becomes an important biochemical link in the metabolism, pharmacology, and toxicology of ethanol and these glycosides, structurally unrelated agents that are both used widely.']",

Plants were grown under a 35% or 65% RH regime in silica sand maintained at 33% w/w moisture or under a water stress regime at 65% RH. Approximately 26, 39, 86, 93 and 100% of the applied 14(C)-activity from the 2-ethylhexyl ester, acid, monoethanolamine salt, 1-decyl ester and potassium salt, respectively, were recovered 72 h after application to glass cover slips placed in the growth room. However, loss of applied 14(C)-activity after application of the five formulations to both plant species was significant only for the 2-ethylhexyl ester. Regardless of environmental regime, the acid was the most readily absorbed formulation. In contrast to the acid, the salts and esters were less readily absorbed.

However, significantly smaller quantities of the absorbed 2-ethylhexyl and 1-decyl ester were exported from the treated leaf.

Urinary 2,2-dichloro-2-fluoroethyl glucuronide was hydrolyzed to 2,2-dichloro-2-fluoroethanol by incubation with beta-glucuronidase, and the released 2,2-dichloro-2-fluoroethanol was quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Concentrations of 2,2-dichloro-2-fluoroethanol were highest in the urine samples collected 4-12 hr after exposure, but 2,2-dichloro-2-fluoroethanol was also detected in the samples collected 0-4 and 12-24 hr after exposure. Exposure concentration-dependent excretion of 2,2-dichloro-2-fluoroethanol, obtained by hydrolysis of 2,2-dichloro-2-fluoroethyl glucuronide, was observed in seven of the eight subjects studied. In conclusion, 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane is metabolized in human subjects to 2,2-dichloro-2-fluoroethanol, which is conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted as its glucuronide in urine in a time- and exposure concentration-dependent manner.""]",

Rats were exposed to decane vapors at time-weighted average concentrations of 1200, 781, or 273 ppm in a 32-L Leach chamber for 4 hr. Time-course samples for 1200 ppm and end-of-exposure samples for 781 and 273 ppm decane exposures were collected from blood, brain, liver, fat, bone marrow, lung, skin, and spleen. The pharmacokinetics of decane could not be described by flow-limited assumptions and measured in vitro tissue/air partition coefficients. A refined PBPK model for decane was then developed using flow-limited (liver and lung) and diffusion-limited (brain, bone marrow, fat, skin, and spleen) equations to describe the uptake and clearance of decane in the blood and tissues. Partition coefficient values for blood/air and tissue/blood were estimated by fitting end-of-exposure pharmacokinetic data and assumed to reflect the available decane for rapid exchange with blood. A portion of decane is speculated to be sequestered in ""deep"" pools in the body, unavailable for rapid exchange with blood. PBPK model predictions were adequate in describing the tissues and blood kinetics. For model validation, the refined PBPK model for decane had mixed successes at predicting tissue and blood concentrations for lower concentrations of decane vapor, suggesting that further improvements in the model may be necessary to extrapolate to lower concentrations.', 'Rat tissue:air and blood:air partition coefficients (PCs) for octane, nonane, decane, undecane, and dodecane (n-C8 to n-C12 n-alkanes) were determined by vial equilibration. The blood:air PC values for n-C8 to n-C12 were 3.1, 5.8, 8.1, 20.4, and 24.6, respectively. The lipid solubility of n-alkanes increases with carbon length, suggesting that lipid solubility is an important determinant in describing n-alkane blood:air PC values. The muscle:blood, liver: blood, brain:blood, and fat:blood PC values were octane (1.0, 1.9, 1.4, and 247), nonane (0.8, 1.9, 3.8, and 274), decane (0.9, 2.0, 4.8, and 328), undecane (0.7, 1.5, 1.7, and 529), and dodecane (1.2, 1.9, 19.8, and 671), respectively. The tissue:blood PC values were greatest in fat and the least in muscle. The brain:air PC value for undecane was inconsistent with other n-alkane values. Using the measured partition coefficient values of these n-alkanes, linear regression was used to predict tissue (except brain) and blood:air partition coefficient values for larger n-alkanes, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, hexadecane, and heptadecane (n-C13 to n-C17). Good agreement between measured and predicted tissue:air and blood:air partition coefficient values for n-C8 to n-Cl2 offer confidence in the partition coefficient predictions for longer chain n-alkanes.', 'Dermal absorption of alkanes with more than eight carbons (octane) occurs very slowly. The distribution of the C10-C12 aliphatics would likely follow the same pattern reported for n-octane. /Decane, undecane, and dodecane (C10-C12)/', 'Absorption of decane occurs mainly by inhalation.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for n-Decane (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['Alternative fuels are being considered for civilian and military uses. One of these is S-8, a replacement jet fuel synthesized using the Fischer-Tropsch process, which contains no aromatic compounds and is mainly composed of straight and branched alkanes. Metabolites of S-8 fuel in laboratory animals have not been identified. The goal of this study was to identify metabolic products from exposure to aerosolized S-8 and a designed straight-chain alkane/polyaromatic mixture (decane, undecane, dodecane, tridecane, tetradecane, pentadecane, naphthalene, and 2-methylnaphthalene) in male Fischer 344 rats. Collected blood and tissue samples were analyzed for 70 straight and branched alcohols and ketones ranging from 7 to 15 carbons. No fuel metabolites were observed in the blood, lungs, brain, and fat following S-8 exposure. Metabolites were detected in the liver, urine, and feces. Most of the metabolites were 2- and 3-position alcohols and ketones of prominent hydrocarbons with very few 1- or 4-position metabolites. Following exposure to the alkane mixture, metabolites were observed in the blood, liver, and lungs. Interestingly, heavy metabolites (3-tridecanone, 2-tridecanol, and 2-tetradecanol) were observed only in the lung tissues possibly indicating that metabolism occurred in the lungs. With the exception of these heavy metabolites, the metabolic profiles observed in this study are consistent with previous studies reporting on the metabolism of individual alkanes. Further work is needed to determine the potential metabolic interactions of parent, primary, and secondary metabolites and identify more polar metabolites. Some metabolites may have potential use as biomarkers of exposure to fuels.', 'Jet propellant 8 (JP-8) jet fuel is a complex mixture of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. The aim of this study was to determine in vitro metabolic rate constants for semivolatile n-alkanes, nonane (C9), decane (C10), and tetradecane (C14), by rat liver microsomal oxidation. The metabolism was assessed by measuring the disappearance of parent compound by gas chromatography. Various concentrations of n-alkanes were incubated with liver microsomes from adult male F-344 rats. Nonlinear kinetic constants for nonane and decane were V(max) (nmol/mg protein/min) = 7.26 +/- 0.20 and 2.80 +/- 0.35, respectively, and K(M) (micro M) = 294.83 +/- 68.67 and 398.70 +/- 42.70, respectively. Metabolic capacity as assessed by intrinsic clearance (V(max)/K(M)) was approximately four-fold higher for nonane (0.03 +/- 0.005) than for decane (0.007 +/- 0.001). There was no appreciable metabolism of tetradecane even with higher microsomal protein concentration and longer incubation time. These results show a negative correlation between metabolic clearance and chain length of n-alkanes. These metabolic rate constants will be used to update existing physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for nonane and decane as part of developing a PBPK model for JP-8.', 'Decane is metabolized in rats to hydroxy derivates before being converted to the respective keto form, using a cytochrome P450-microsomal oxidase mixed function. Decane hydroxylation has been observed in liver microsomal fractions obtained from mice, rats, rabbits, cows, pigeons, and chick embryos. In rats, hydroxylation takes place not only in liver, but in other organs and microsomes isolated from the kidney and lungs.', 'Decane was oxidized by microsomes from livers of mouse, rat, rabbit, beef, pigeon and chick embryo. The oxidation of decane by mouse liver microsomes required NADPH and oxygen. Decanol, decanoic acid and decamethylene glycol were major metabolites of decane oxidation, suggesting that decane oxidation is inititated by hydroxylation of decane to decanol.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for n-Decane (8 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']",

Biliary (14)C was excreted at a rate similar to the excretion of (14)C in the feces of rats fed (14)C-TCDD in a previous study. Selective solvent extraction revealed that the biliary (14)C activity was due to compound more polar than TCDD itself. Incubation of bile with beta-glucuronidase resulted in the extraction of more (14)C activity, implying the presence of glucuronide conjugates of (14)C-TCDD metabolites.

PCA was readily demethylated by both species, with a half-life of 5-8 min. The resultant PCP was the major metabolite in dogs and pigs. In the dog, an average of 21.9% of the administered radiolabel was excreted in the urine and 62.3% in the feces during a 7 day period. Of the tissues analyzed, an average of 3.2% of the radiolabel remained in the liver, and blood and muscle accounted for averages of 3.0 and 2.3%, respectively, of the dose. Free and conjugated PCP were found in the urine of dogs; no PCA or tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCH) were found. In dog feces, PCP and a trace of polar material were observed; no PCA was excreted in dog feces. In the miniature pig, an average of 25.8% of the administered radiolabel was excreted in the urine and 32.0% in the feces during a 2-wk period. An average of 4.4% of the radiolabel was found in the liver, 8.8% in the blood, 7.1% in the muscle and 6.4% in the fat. In pig urine, PCP and conjugated PCP were the only metabolites observed; no PCA or TCH was found. Pig feces contained a trace of unchanged PCA; PCP and polar metabolites were also found. Since pig tissues retained a sizeable residue 2 wk after a single dose of PCA, various agents were used in an attempt to decrease the tissue level of radiolabel in pigs; anion exchange resin was found to be the most effective.', 'Toxicokinetics of pentachloroanisole (PCA) were studied in F344 rat and B6C3F1 mouse of both sexes by gavage at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg and by iv at 10 mg/kg. PCA was rapidly demethylated to pentachlorophenol (PCP) in both rat and mouse and the resulting PCP plasma concentrations were much higher than that of parent PCA due to the much smaller apparent volume of distribution of PCP. Peak plasma concentrations of PCA and PCP increased with dose in both rat and mouse. Bioavailability of PCA was low in both rat and mouse and was sex independent. The high plasma concentrations and relatively long biological half-life of PCP in both species after both iv and oral dosing with PCA indicate possible bioaccumulation of PCP upon multiple oral administrations of PCA.', 'Male Sprague-Dawley rats and New Zealand White rabbits were admin (14)C-labelled pentachloroanisole (PCA) in corn oil by gavage as single doses of 25 mg/kg and were then placed in individual metabolism cages for as long as 4 days. Peak blood level of radioactivity occurred 6 hr after admin of the dose to rats and between 3 and 4 hr in rabbits; the blood elimination half-life ranged from 8 to 15 hr in rats and averaged 6 hr in rabbits. Rats excreted an average of 54.2% of the admin radiolabel in the urine and 32.4% in the feces during the 96 hr following the dose; rabbits excreted an average of 84.2 and 13.1% of the radiolabel in the urine and faces, respectively, during this time. Examination of the metabolites in the rat showed that 60% of the urinary radioactivity was attributable to tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCH), 3% to free pentachlorophenol (PCP) and 29% to conjugated PCP; fecal metabolites were PCP (85.7%), TCH (4.3%) and polar metabolites (10.0%). In the rabbit, 58% of the urinary radioactivity was attributable to TCH, 8% to free PCP and 34% to conjugated PCP.

At higher dose (200 mg/kg) a considerably lower proportion (8%) of the absorbed dose is excreted in bile, indicating that this is a saturable process. These data indicate that overall absorption from the GI tract is in the order of 30-32% of the administered dose. The majority ... is excreted in feces with at least 80% of administered dose excreted by this route within 96 hr. Approximately 90% of the administered dose was excreted within 34-48 hr although excretion was less rapid at doses of 50 mg/kg and above. Highest tissue concentrations were observed in the kidney, approximately 0.1% of the dose. A similar metabolic profile was seen on repeated dosing and there was no evidence of bioaccumulation.', '... Data for the monkey show that, following a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg, 1.8-4.15% of the dose appeared in urine with very low levels of thiol-derived metabolites appearing in urine. Fecal excretion predominated with around 92% of the dose eliminated via this route over 96 hr. Absorption and excretion were rapid and there was no evidence of bioaccumulation.', 'Low levels of /orally administered chlorothalonil to mouse/ were found in the tissues and urinary excretion indicated that at least 10% of the dose was absorbed with the majority (70-80%) of the dose excreted in feces.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for CHLOROTHALONIL (12 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['When yeast cells were exposed to TCIN, derivatives formed resembled those formed by reaction of glutathione with TCIN in vitro. Coenzyme A and 2-mercaptoethanol also ... formed derivatives with TCIN in vitro. Infrared spectra and chromatography of the 4 derivatives ... indicated ... 1-4 halogens ... substituted by 2-mercaptoethanol. ... Daconil decomposed in fresh rumen contents with production of two unidentified metabolites.', 'In plants, 4-hydroxy-2,5,6-trichloroisophthalonitrile is found as a metabolite.', 'The metabolism of chlorothalonil was investigated in liver and gill cytosolic and microsomal fractions from channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) using HPLC. All fractions catalyzed the metabolism of chlorothalonil to polar metabolites. Chlorothalonil metabolism by cytosolic fractions was reduced markedly when glutathione was omitted from the reaction mixtures. The lack of microsomal metabolism in the presence of either NADPH or an NADPH-regenerating system indicated direct glutathione S-transferase catalyzed conjugation with glutathione without prior oxidation by cytochrome P450. Cytosolic and microsomal glutathione S-transferases from both tissues were also active toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, a commonly employed reference substrate. In summary, channel catfish detoxified chlorothalonil in vitro by glutathione S-transferase-catalyzed glutathione conjugation in the liver and gill. The present report is the first to confirm microsomal glutathione S-transferase activity toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in gill and toward chlorothalonil in liver, and also of gill cytosolic glutathione S-transferase activity towards chlorothalonil, in an aquatic species.', 'Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered, via oral gavage, (14)C-chlorothalonil (purity 99.7%) at a dose level of 200 mg/kg in order to isolate and identify the urinary metabolites. Urine was collected 17, 24 and 48 hr after dosing. Urinary metabolites accounted for 2.4% of the administered dose and, except for 30% of the radiolabel which was non-extractable from the urine, were found to be trimethylthiomonochloro-isophthalonitrile and dimethylthiodichloro-isophthalonitrile. These thiols were excreted in urine both as free thiols and as their methylated derivatives. ...A metabolic pathway /was suggested/ such that hepatic metabolism proceeds through conjugation with GSH followed by enzymatic degradation. The smaller conjugates are then transported via the bloodstream to the kidney, where they are converted to thiol metabolites and excreted in the urine.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for CHLOROTHALONIL (12 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']",

During the course of this study the possible effects of dietary pristane on chromatin conformation of lymphoid cells were also examined by flow cytometry. The data indicated that 1) pristane crossed the placenta and accumulated in fetal tissues, 2) neonates were exposed to pristane via the colostrum, 3) there were significant increases in the amount of tissue-associated pristane in young adults and subsequent redistribution of the pristane to the muscle and adipose tissues in older rats and 4) after dietary exposure, significantly elevated levels of pristane were associated with the tissues and concomitant changes in chromatin conformation were observed.

The mechanism of hydrolysis is different for  N -methyl and  N -dimethyl derivatives.  The  N -methyl carbamates pass through an isocyanate intermediate, whereas in the hydrolysis of  N - dimethylcarbamates, an addition product with a hydroxyl ion is formed yielding the alcohol and  N -dimethyl substituted acid.  The rate of hydrolysis by esterases is faster in mammals than in plants and insects. Apart from hydrolysis, oxidation also takes place including: hydroxylation of the aromatic ring,  O -dealkylation,  N -methyl hydroxylation,  N -dealkylation, oxidation of aliphatic side chains, and sulfoxidation to the corresponding sulfone. Oxidation is associated with the mixed-function oxidase (MFO) enzymes. Conjugation leads to the formation of  O - and  N -glucuronides, sulfates, and mercapturic acid derivatives in mammals.

In this phase 1, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial, we evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of three oral doses of Namisol(), a novel THC in tablet form, in older subjects. Twelve healthy older subjects (6 male; mean age 72+/-5 years) randomly received a single oral dose of 3 mg, 5 mg, or 6.5 mg of THC or matching placebo, in a crossover manner, on each intervention day. The data for 11 subjects were included in the analysis. The data of 1 subject were excluded due to non-compliance to study medication. THC was safe and well tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) were drowsiness (27%) and dry mouth (11%). Subjects reported more AEs with THC 6.5mg than with 3mg (p=0.048), 5mg (p=0.034) and placebo (p=0.013). There was a wide inter-individual variability in plasma concentrations of THC. Subjects for whom the Cmax fell within the sampling period (over 2hr), Cmax was 1.42-4.57 ng/mL and Tmax was 67-92 min. The AUC0-2 hr (n=11) was 1.67-3.51 ng/mL. Overall, the pharmacodynamic effects of THC were smaller than effects previously reported in young adults. In conclusion, THC appeared to be safe and well tolerated by healthy older individuals. Data on safety and effectiveness of THC in frail older persons are urgently required, as this population could benefit from the therapeutic applications of THC.', 'RATIONALE: Data on safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are lacking in dementia patients. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we evaluated the safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of THC in ten patients with dementia (mean age 77.3 +/-5.6). For 12 weeks, participants randomly received oral THC (weeks 1-6, 0.75 mg; weeks 7-12, 1.5 mg) or placebo twice daily for 3 days, separated by a 4-day washout period. RESULTS: Only 6 of the 98 reported adverse events were related to THC. Visual analog scale (VAS) feeling high, VAS external perception, body sway-eyes-open, and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly different with THC. After the 0.75-mg dose, VAS internal perception (0.025 units; 95% CI 0.010-0.040) and heart rate (2 beats/min; 95% CI 0.4-3.8) increased significantly. Body sway-eyes-closed increased only after 1.5 mg (0.59 deg/s; 95% CI 0.13-1.06). Systolic blood pressure changed significantly after both doses of THC (0.75 mg, -7 mmHg, 95% CI -11.4, -3.0; 1.5 mg, 5 mmHg, 95% CI 1.0-9.2). The median T max was 1-2 hr, with THC pharmacokinetics increasing linearly with increasing dose, with wide interindividual variability (CV% up to 140%). The mean C max (ng/mL) after the first dose (0-6 hr) was 0.41 (0.18-0.90) for the 0.75-mg dose and 1.01 (0.53-1.92) for the 1.5-mg dose. After the second dose (6-24 hr), the C max was 0.50 (0.27-0.92) and 0.98 (0.46-2.06), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: THC was rapidly absorbed and had dose-linear pharmacokinetics with considerable interindividual variation. Pharmacodynamic effects, including adverse events, were minor. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the pharmacodynamics and efficacy of higher THC doses in older persons with dementia.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for delta 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (32 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","[""THC is primarily metabolized in the liver by microsomal hydroxylation and oxidation reactions catalyzed by Cytochrome P450 enzymes. 11-hydroxy-▵9-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC) is the primary active metabolite, capable of producing psychological and behavioural effects, which is then metabolized into 11-nor-9-carboxy-▵ 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH), THC's primary inactive metabolite. Dronabinol and its principal active metabolite, 11-OH-delta-9-THC, are present in approximately equal concentrations in plasma.

However, much less is known about the formation and fate of cannabinoid conjugates. Bile excretion is known to be an important route for the elimination of phase II metabolites. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS procedure for measuring cannabinoids in oral fluid was adapted, validated and applied to 10 bile samples. THC, 11-hydroxy-delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC), 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH), cannabinol (CBN), cannabidiol (CBD), delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid A (THC-A), 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol glucuronide (THCCOOH-gluc) and delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol glucuronide (THC-gluc) were determined following solid-phase extraction and LC-MS/MS. High concentrations of THCCOOH-gluc were found in bile samples (range: 139-21,275 ng/mL). Relatively high levels of THCCOOH (7.7-1548 ng/mL) and THC-gluc (38-1366 ng/mL) were also measured. THC-A, the plant precursor of THC, was the only cannabinoid that was not detected. These results show that biliary excretion is an important route of elimination for cannabinoids conjugates and that their enterohepatic recirculation is a significant factor to consider when analyzing blood elimination profiles of cannabinoids. Furthermore, we suggest that the bile is the matrix of choice for the screening of phase II cannabinoid metabolites.', 'The presence of the metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (C-THC) in hair is generally accepted as the definitive proof of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) ingestion. During hair analysis, the removal of any potential C-THC external contamination that could result from marijuana smoke or close personal contact via a wash procedure is critical. Here, we performed a series of experiments to demonstrate that C-THC is the reliable indicator of marijuana ingestion when paired with the correct washing procedure to remove potential external contamination.', 'Dronabinol undergoes extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism, primarily by microsomal hydroxylation, yielding both active and inactive metabolites.

Most of the orally administered dose (94-96%) became systemically available within 6 hr. Following dermal administration 10% of the dose became systemically available over 72 hr. However, peak concentrations in blood and kidney were achieved within 30 min of dosing by either route. By 1.5 hr after dosing, 2,4-D concentrations in blood, muscle, liver, and kidneys had decreased in both the orally dosed and dermally dosed animals. Between 2 and 8 hr, the blood, muscle, liver, and kidney concentrations in dermally dosed animals maintained a plateau while urinary excretion increased, presumably due to continued absorption 2,4-D from the skin. The concentrations in orally dosed animals continued to decrease.

In addition, pimozide, in common with other antipsychotic drugs, has various effects on other central nervous system receptor systems which are not fully characterized.

In cats given daily dermal doses of 0.5 mg/kg EPN for 10 days, 62% fo the total dose was given daily dermal doses of 0.5 mg/kg EPN for 10 days, 62% of the total dose was eliminated in the urine. Thus, the metabolism and toxicokinetics of EPN in the cat are intermediate between those in the rat and in the chicken. Similarly to the rat, EPN is excreted as polar metabolite, mostly in the urine. As int he chicken, however, EPN is persistent in cat tissues, especially in nervous tissues. The finding that the cat is ten times less sensitive than the chicken to subchronic dermal exposure to EPN may be explained by the relatively rapid metabolism and elimination of EPN in the cat.', '...Elimination of the phosphorus-containing residue may be via the urine or feces. Some bound residues remain in exposed animals. Binding seems to be to proteins, principally, and the turnover appears to be related to the half-life of these proteins. There are limited data showing that incorporation of residues into DNA occurs only in trace amounts and not by direct alkylation, such as might be believed to be associated with genetic damage. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/']","['Yields p-aminophenyl ethyl benzenethiophosphonate in rat, guinea pig, mouse, sparrow, chicken, sucker, bass, alewife, flounder, sunfish, bullhead, sculpin and bluegill. /from table/', 'Rabbit sera brought about removal of sulfur and hydrolysis to p-nitrophenol. ...After incubation of EPN with nadph2, oxygen and microsomes of rat, housefly, or rabbit liver, corresponding phenol was found in each case.

Five different GE, the diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A (BADGE), 4,4'-dihydroxy-3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbiphenyl (Epikote YX4000) and 1,6-hexanediol (HDDGE) and the GE of 1-dodecanol (C12GE) and o-cresol (o-CGE), were synthesized by reaction of their alcohols with epichlorohydrin. Their radiolabelled analogues were synthesized with a 14C-label using [U-14C]-epichlorohydrin. There was a large variation (four orders of magnitude) in percutaneous penetration between the five GE. In general, penetration through full-thickness mouse skin was higher than through dermatomed rat skin, whereas dermatomed human skin was the least permeable. The permeability increased in the order YX4000 < BADGE < C12GE < o-CGE < HDDGE. The relative skin permeability of the five GE could be explained for a significant part by the lipophilicity, expressed as log P(o/w), in combination with the molecular weight of the compounds.""]","['o-Cresyl glycidyl ether was converted rapidly to the corresponding diol compounds when incubated with guinea pig liver homogenate in vitro. /o-Cresyl glycidyl ether/', 'Studies in preparations of microsomal and cytosolic fractions of liver and lung derived from human, rat, and mouse showed that o-cresyl glycidyl ether is a good substrate for glutathione tranferase, with mice being the most efficient in enzymatic glutathione conjugation. Overall, enzymatic hydrolysis of the epoxide group is the most important route of in vitro biotransformation of o-cresyl glycidyl ether, with the highest activity located in the microsomes. Human samples generally had a higher efficiency for hydrolysis than mice or rats. /o-Cresyl glycidyl ether/', 'The urinary metabolite profile of o-cresyl glycidyl ether in rats, following ip administration of single doses up to 164 mg/kg, indicated that glutathione (GSH) conjugation and epoxide hydrolysis were key biotransformation pathways of o-cresyl glycidyl ether. At low dose levels GSH conjugation and epoxide hydrolysis accounted each for about 25% of urinary metabolites; however at higher doses epoxide hydrolysis became the most prominent route of detoxification (40%). /o-Cresyl glycidyl ether/', 'The urinary metabolite profiles of phenyl-glycidyl-ether (PGE) and its structural analogue ortho-cresyl-glycidyl-ether (oCGE) were determined in male Wistar-rats. Quantitative analytical methods were used to investigate the metabolites of PGE and oCGE, their dose excretion relationships and urinary excretion kinetics. Rats were dosed intraperitoneally with PGE or oCGE in doses ranging from 0.033 to 1.0 mmol/kg. ...Rats treated with oCGE excreted oCGEMA, COLA, and NAPS, showing that the metabolite profiles of PGE and oCGE were comparable. The quantitative methods developed to determine the urinary mercapturic-acid metabolites of PGE and oCGE offered enough selectivity and sensitivity for their determination as low as 0.033mmol/kg. The authors conclude the method can be used for humans with low potential exposures. Human excretion of lactic-acid and the novel serine metabolites of these glycidyl ethers should be further investigated, as possible inactivation of these epoxides may be by epoxide hydrolysis mediated routes.', '... During skin penetration, all GE were extensively metabolized to their corresponding (bis-)diols. Virtually no YX4000, and only very small amounts of C12GE and BADGE, penetrated the skin unchanged, but significant amounts of HDDGE and o-CGE penetrated the skin unchanged. For o-CGE, but none of the other GE, the percentage of the applied dose that penetrated the skin unchanged increased over time. The large variation in response observed with the five selected GE indicates that GE should not be considered as a single class of compounds but rather on the basis of their individual properties.']",

Similarly, more [3H] remained in the tissues of rats treated with [3H]-PCE than in the tissues of [3H4-PCP-treated rats.

Because PCE and PCA are major metabolites of PCDE, their plasma levels were also measured after administration of PCDE. Similarly, PCA concentrations was determined after administration of PCE. The data were combined and analyzed by nonlinear regression procedures using compartmental and noncompartmental models to determine the kinetic parameters of PCDE metabolism. The object was to estimate the kinetic constants for the metabolic sequence, PCDE to PCE to PCA. A 6-compartment model (two pools for each analyte) that included saturable components for the conversion of PCDE to PCE and PCE to PCA gave the best fit to the combined data. Despite large uncertainties for some microparameters, useful estimates were obtained for clearances, distribution volumes, and fraction of PCDE or PCE converted to PCE and PCA in vivo under nonsaturating conditions. The estimated fraction of PCDE converted to PCA and the apparent Km value for the conversion of PCDE to PCE were comparable to values obtained in vitro with microsomal preparations, suggesting that metabolic studies in vitro provide reasonable predictors of the biotransformation process in vivo for this class of compounds.', 'The isolated perfused lung (IPL) of rats were used to examine the pulmonary disposition and metabolism of radiolabeled phencyclidine (PCP) and N-ethyl-1-phenylcyclohexylamine (PCE).

We have studied the benzylic hydroxylation of 1-methylpyrene (MP), a hepatocarcinogen in rodents, and 1-ethylpyrene (EP), whose benzylic hydroxylation would produce a secondary alcohol (alpha-HEP), in contrast to the primary alcohol (alpha-HMP) formed from MP. The hydrocarbons were incubated with hepatic microsomal preparations from humans and rats, as well as with V79-derived cell lines engineered for the expression of individual cytochrome P450 (CYP) forms from human (1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 2E1, 3A4) and rat (1A1, 1A2, 2B1). All microsomal systems and CYP-expressing cell lines used, but not CYP-deficient V79 cells, showed biotransformation of both hydrocarbons. Formation of the benzylic alcohol was detected in each case. alpha-HMP and its oxidation product, 1-pyrenylcarboxylic acid (COOH-P), accounted for a major part of the total amount of the metabolites formed from MP in the presence of human liver microsomes (38-64%) and cells expressing human 3A4, 2E1 or 1B1 (80-85%). Likewise, cells expressing human 1A1 showed a higher contribution of alpha-HMP and COOH-P to the total metabolites (45%) than cells expressing the orthologous enzyme of the rat (3%). EP was metabolized at a higher rate and with modified regioselectivity compared with MP, although omega-hydroxylation of the side chain was not detected with the cell lines and only accounted for a small percent of the biotransformation by the microsomal preparations. The highest contributions of alpha-HEP to the total metabolites from EP were detected with the cells expressing human 1A1, 1B1 and 3A4 (38-51%). alpha-HEP accounted for 16% of the metabolites formed in the presence of human hepatic microsomes. Thus, benzylic hydroxylation is a major initial step in the metabolism of MP and EP. This pathway appears to be even more important in humans than in rats. Previously, we had shown that the second step of the activation, the sulfonation of alpha-HMP and alpha-HEP, is also efficiently catalysed by various forms of human sulfotransferases.', '1-Methylpyrene, an alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and environmental carcinogen, is activated by side-chain hydroxylation to 1-hydroxymethylpyrene (1-HMP) and subsequent sulfo conjugation to the DNA-reactive 1-sulfooxymethylpyrene. In addition to the bioactivation, processes of metabolic detoxification and transport greatly influence the genotoxicity of 1-methylpyrene. For a better understanding of 1-HMP detoxification in vivo we studied urinary and fecal metabolites in rats following intraperitoneal doses of 19.3 mg 1-HMP/kg body weight (5 rats) or the same dose containing 200?Ci [(14)C]1-HMP/kg body weight (2 rats). After 48h, 48.0% (rat 1) and 29.1% (rat 2) of the radioactivity was recovered as 1-HMP in the feces. Six major metabolites were observed by UV and on-line radioactivity detection in urine samples and feces after HPLC separation. The compounds were characterized by mass spectrometry, (1)H NMR and (1)H-(1)H COSY NMR spectroscopy, which allowed assigning tentative molecular structures. Two prominent metabolites, 1-pyrene carboxylic acid (M-6) and the acyl glucuronide of 1-pyrene carboxylic acid (M-5) accounted for 17.7% (rat 1) and 25.2% (rat 2) of the overall radioactive dose. Further, we detected the acyl glucuronide of 6-hydroxy-1-pyrene carboxylic acid (M-1) and 8-sulfooxy-1-pyrene carboxylic acid (M-3) together with two regioisomers of M-3 (M-2 and M-4) differing in position of the sulfate group at the pyrene ring. In urine samples, the radioactivity of 1-pyrene carboxylic acid and its five derivatives amounted to 32.4% (rat 1) or 45.5% (rat 2) of the total [(14)C]1-HMP dose.', 'Transformation of nonsubstituted and alkyl-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by the benthic invertebrate Nereis diversicolor was compared in this study. Pyrene and 1-methylpyrene were used as model compounds for nonsubstituted and alkyl-substituted PAHs, respectively. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of metabolites and parent compounds in worm tissue, water, and sediment were performed. Transformation of 1-methylpyrene generated the benzylic hydroxylated phase I product, 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid that comprised 90% of the total metabolites of 1-methylpyrene, and was mainly found in water extracts. We tentatively identified 1-methylpyrene glucuronides and 1-carbonylpyrene glycine as phase II metabolites not previously reported in literature. Pyrene was biotransformed to 1-hydroxypyrene, pyrene-1-sulfate, pyrene-1-glucuronide, and pyrene glucoside sulfate, with pyrene-1-glucuronide as the most prominent metabolite. Transformation of 1-methylpyrene (21% transformed) was more than 3 times as efficient as pyrene transformation (5.6% transformed). Because crude oils contain larger amounts of C?-C?-substituted PAHs than nonsubstituted PAHs, the rapid and efficient transformation of sediment-associated 1-methylpyrene may result in a high exposure of water-living organisms to metabolites of alkyl-substituted PAHs, whose toxicities are unknown. ...', ""The common polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 1-methylpyrene is hepatocarcinogenic in the newborn mouse assay. In vitro studies showed that it is metabolically activated via benzylic hydroxylation and sulphation to a reactive ester, which forms benzylic DNA adducts, N(2)-(1-methylpyrenyl)-2'-deoxyguanosine (MPdG) and N(6)-(1-methylpyrenyl)-2'-deoxyadenosine (MPdA). Formation of these adducts was also observed in animals treated with the metabolites, 1-hydroxymethylpyrene and 1-sulphooxymethylpyrene (1-SMP), whereas corresponding data are missing for 1-methylpyrene. In the present study, we treated mice with 1-methylpyrene and subsequently analyzed blood serum for the presence of the reactive metabolite 1-SMP and tissue DNA for the presence of MPdG and MPdA adducts. We used wild-type mice and a mouse line transgenic for human sulphotransferases (SULT) 1A1 and 1A2, males and females. All analyses were conducted using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, for the adducts with isotope-labelled internal standards. 1-SMP was detected in all treated animals. Its serum level was higher in transgenic mice than in the wild-type (p < 0.001). Likewise, both adducts were detected in liver, kidney and lung DNA of all exposed animals. The transgene significantly enhanced the level of each adduct in each tissue of both sexes (p < 0.01-0.001). Adduct levels were highest in the liver, the target tissue of carcinogenesis, in each animal model used. MPdG and MPdA adducts were also observed in rats treated with 1-methylpyrene. Our findings corroborate the hypothesis that 1-SMP is indeed the ultimate carcinogen of 1-methylpyrene and that human SULT are able to mediate the terminal activation in vivo."", 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for 1-Methylpyrene (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']",

Regardless of the enzyme source, the metabolically formed 8-MeBaA trans-3,4- and -5,6-dihydrodiols were found to be enriched in one enantiomeric isomer and differed only in the degree of optical purity. The 8-MeBaA trans-8,9-dihydrodiol formed by liver microsomes from either untreated or phenobarbital-treated rats was enriched with the (+)-enantiomer. In contrast, the 8-MeBaA trans-8,9-dihydrodiol formed either by liver microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats or by the reconstituted rat liver enzyme system containing cytochrome P-448 and epoxide hydrolase was enriched with the (-)enantiomer. These results indicate that, in catalyzing the formation of 3,4- and 5,6-epoxide intermediates, the interaction with the unsubstituted 3,4- and 5,6-double bonds of 8-MeBaA by the different forms of cytochrome P-450 occur preferentially on the same face of the aromatic plane and they differ only in the degree of stereoselectivity. However, different forms of cytochrome P-450 may interact with different faces of the aromatic plane at the methyl-substituted 8,9-double bond of 8-MeBaA, resulting in the formation of trans-8,9-dihydrodiols enriched in different enantiomeric forms. This demonstrates that different forms of cytochrome P-450 may catalyze the epoxidation reaction preferentially at different sides of the methyl-substituted double bond of a planar polycyclic hydrocarbon molecule. These properties may be used to further classify and to understand the enzyme-substrate interactions of the different forms of cytochrome P-450 in the drug-metabolizing enzyme systems.', 'Metabolism of the carcinogen 8-hydroxymethylbenz[a]anthracene (8-HOCH2-BA) with liver microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats resulted in 12 identifiable metabolites. Trans-1,2-, 3,4-5,6-, 8,9-, and 10,11-dihydrodiols are among the identified metabolites. The major enantiomers of the trans-dihydrodiols have 1R,2R, 3R,4R, 5R,6R, 8S,9S, and 10R,11R absolute configurations, respectively. Metabolites formed by liver microsomes from untreated as well as 3-methylcholanthrene-, phenobarbital-, and polychlorinated biphenyl-treated immature male Sprague-Dawley rats were quantified by using specifically tritium-labeled [3H-CH2]8-HOCH2-BA as the substrate. The identification of an 8,9-dihydrodiol as a metabolite of 8-HOCH2-BA indicates that a hydroxymethyl substituent does not prevent the enzymatic oxidation at the hydroxymethyl-substituted 8,9-double bond of 8-HOCH2-BA. ...']",

These results support the hypothesis that for most, if not all, unsubstituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon carcinogens, the chemical or biochemical introduction of an alkyl group in the meso-anthracenic position(s) or L-region is a structural requirement for strong carcinogenic activity. Here we report that the L-region methyl derivatives 7-MBA, 12-MBA and 7,12-DMBA are oxidized to hydroxymethyl derivatives by a rat liver cytosol preparation without any apparent oxidation of the ring positions.', 'The homogeneous 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase of rat liver cytosol catalyzes the NADP-dependent oxidation of a wide variety of polycyclic aromatic trans-dihydrodiols and has been implicated in their detoxification. This study examined the influence of methyl groups on the velocity and stereochemical course of enzymatic benz(a)anthracene (BA) trans-dihydrodiol oxidation. The racemic trans-3,4-dihydrodiols of BA and 7-methylbenz(a)anthracene (7-MBA) were completely consumed by the purified dehydrogenase, indicating that both stereoisomers are substrates. However, 50% of the ( +/- )-trans-3,4-dihydrodiols of 12-methylbenz(a)anthracene (12-MBA) and 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)-anthracene (DMBA) were oxidized, suggesting that only one stereoisomer is utilized in each case. At low substrate concentrations, enzymatic oxidation of the trans-3,4-dihydrodiols of BA, 12-MBA, and DMBA followed simple first-order kinetics. By contrast, oxidation of the 3,4-dihydrodiol of 7-MBA was of higher order, due to differences in the rate of oxidation of each stereoisomer. Rate constants estimated for each reaction indicate that the non-bay-region methyl group at position 7 has a greater enhancing effect on the rate of oxidation than the bay-region methyl group at position 12 (10- versus 4-fold, respectively). The 3,4-dihydrodiol of DMBA, which possesses both non-bay- and bay-region methyl groups, is oxidized more than 30 times faster than the unmethylated parent hydrocarbon. The absolute stereochemistry of the preferentially oxidized dihydrodiols was assigned by circular dichroism spectrometry. For the 3,4-dihydrodiols of DMBA and 12-MBA, the stereoisomer oxidized has the 3S,4S configuration. A large negative Cotton effect was observed in the circular dichroism spectrum of the 7-MBA 3,4-dihydrodiol which remained at the end of the rapid phase of oxidation of this racemic substrate, indicating that the dehydrogenase displays partial stereochemical preference for the 3S,4S enantiomer. These results suggest that methylation of BA at C-7 greatly enhances the oxidation of the 3S,4S-dihydrodiol, while the presence of a bay-region methyl group at C-12 completely blocks the oxidation of the 3R,4R-stereoisomer. Rapid, stereoselective oxidation of methylated polycyclic aromatic trans-dihydrodiols by this route in vivo may significantly influence their carcinogenicity.', 'Yields 4-hydroxy-12-methylbenzanthracene, 7-hydroxy-12-methylbenzanthracene, and 12-hydroxymethylbenzanthracene probably in rat. /From table/', 'Yields trans-5,6-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxy-12-methylbenzanthracene in rat; yields trans-8,9-dihydro-8,9-dihydroxy-12-methylbenzanthracene, S-(5,6-dihydro-6-hydroxy-12-methylbenzanthr-5-yl)glutathione, and 3-hydroxy-12-methylbenzanthracene probably in rat. /From table/', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for 12-Methylbenz(a)anthracene (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']",

Each of five rats received a single oral dose of corn-oil containing 20 milligrams per kilogram radiolabeled n-butyl-glycidyl-ether. Two rabbits received the equivalent dose in a gelatin capsule. Excretion was followed by scintillation counting over a period of 96 hours. Analytical methods applied to determine n-butyl-glycidyl-ether and metabolites in urine included thin layer chromatography, autoradiography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Within 24 hours of administration, rats and rabbits excreted 87 percent and 78 percent of the n-butyl-glycidyl-ether dose, respectively. Further elimination was minimal. After 96 hours, total excretion was 92 percent for rats and 80 percent for rabbits.

In rabbits, the major metabolites included 3-butoxy-2-hydroxypropionic-acid, representing 35 percent of total metabolites, and butoxyacetic-acid, representing 5 percent of the metabolites measured. In both species, a major route of biotransformation was via the hydrolytic opening of the epoxide ring followed by oxidation of the resulting diol to 3-butoxy-2-hydroxypropionic-acid and subsequent oxidative decarboxylation to yield butoxyacetic-acid. The metabolite 3-butoxy-2-acetylaminopropionic-acid may have involved cleavage of the epoxide ring by ammonia (7664417) or an amine or may have occurred by animation of a keto acid.

These studies utilized (14)C-labeled Aroclor 1242 and 1254 (mixtures containing 42 or 54% chlorine by mass) in soil, mineral oil, and water. Over a 24-hour period, 2.6, 10, and 43% of the dose was retained in human skin when the Aroclor 1242 was formulated in soil, mineral oil, or water, respectively. Similar results were observed with Aroclor 1254, with 1.6, 6.4, and 44.3% of the dose retained in human skin, following PCB exposure in a soil, mineral oil, or water vehicle, respectively. The in vitro data indicate that PCBs readily enter human skin and are available for systemic absorption, and that the dosing vehicle has a major role in regulating the relative retention of PCBs in human skin.', '... The in vivo percutaneous absorption of PCBs /was assessed/ in adult female Rhesus monkeys. (14)C-Labeled Aroclor 1242 and 1254 were separately administered iv and topically to Rhesus monkeys and urinary and fecal excretion of radioactivity was measured for the next 30 days. Following iv administration, the 30-day cumulative excretion was 55% of the administered dose (39% urine, 16% feces) for Aroclor 1242 and 27% (7% urine, 20% feces) for Aroclor 1254. The percentage of the dose absorbed following topical administration to abdominal skin (after light clipping of hair) was estimated from the ratio of the total urinary and fecal excretion following topical and iv administration. Topical administration of Aroclor 1242 in soil, mineral oil, trichlorobenzene, or acetone resulted in 14, 20, 18, and 21% absorption of the administered dose, respectively.', 'The urinary excretion half-life of an undefined PCB containing 42% chlorine applied to the abdominal skin was 6.9 days in monkeys. In guinea pigs in which the same mixture was applied to the back of the ear, a 2-phase urinary excretion process was observed. The first phase was rapid, with an elimination half-life of 1.9 days, and was followed by a slower phase, with an elimination half-life of 12.6 days. However, the elimination half-life of a PCB containing 54% chlorine was 2.9 days and was linear for the duration (16 days) of the urine collection. /It was/ reported that following percutaneous application of 4 ug (14)C-labeled Aroclor 1242/sq cm to the abdominal skin of monkeys (four per group), a maximum of 11% of the dose (as (14)C-derived radioactivity) was excreted over a 30-day period when the solvent was mineral oil, while 10% was excreted when the solvent was trichlorobenzene (unspecified isomer). Excretion was virtually complete after the first 10 days. Urinary excretion of (14)C-derived radioactivity was approximately 2 times fecal excretion. Following application of 4.8 ug (14)C-labeled Aroclor 1254/sq cm in mineral oil or trichlorobenzene, 5.5 and 3.9% of the dose, respectively, was excreted over a 30 day period. The probability that ... only excretion for the most readily metabolized components /was measured/ is increased because in the most recent study, which specified Aroclor mixtures, urinary excretion was 2 times fecal excretion and urinary excretion was virtually complete after 10 days.', 'Following intravenous injection of 32.7 ug Aroclor 1242 to Rhesus monkeys, 39.4% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine, and 16.1% was excreted in the feces over a 34 day period; the bulk of the dose (> 90%) was excreted within the first 10 days. For Aroclor 1254, 7% of the administered dose (47.4 ug) was excreted in the urine and 19.7% in the feces over a 30-day period.

The relationship between serum lipids, lipohilic toxicants, and the analytes was also evaluated. The beta-glu, 5 nuc, triglycerides, cholesterol, and total bilirubin correlated positively and significantly with log concentrations of serum total PCBs and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorphenyl)ethylene (DDE), a metabolite of DDT. The more highly chlorinated PCBs (Aroclor 1260) had significant, positive correlations with several serum analytes, but the less chlorinated PCBs (Aroclor 1242) correlated significantly and negatively only with HDL-cholesterol. Triglyceride- and cholesterol-rich lipoproteins were added to serum to determine the effects of these assays. Several were spuriously elevated.

For metabolic studies, alpha-terpineol was given once daily for 20 days at a dose of 600mg/kg bw; cytochrome-P-450 studies involved dosing for up to 9 days. ...The neutral fraction isolated showed the presence of one major (alpha-terpineol) and two minor compounds. One of the minor compounds was identified as p-menthane-1,2,8-triol. Further study revealed the presence of the methyl esters of oleuropeic-acid and dihydrooleuropeic-acid. Allylic oxidation of C-1 methyl esters appeared to be the major metabolic pathway. It was considered likely that the allylic methyl group at C-7 was oxidized prior to the reduction of the 1,2-double bond. Administration of alpha-terpineol increased the levels of liver microsomal cytochrome-P-450 by 72, 104, 90, 54, and 52% after 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 days of dosing, respectively. A moderate incr was noted in the levels of liver microsomal NADPH-cytochrome-c-reductase during the first 3 days of repeated dosing. No significant effect was noted on cytochrome-b5 and NADH-cytochrome-c-reductase. The authors conclude that the allylic methyl oxidation of alpha-terpineol is the major route for its metabolic transformation in the rat. The reduction of the endocyclic double bond was specifically noted in the formation of dihydrooleuropeic-acid from oleuropeic-acid.', 'Biotransformation of alpha-terpineol by the common cutworm (Spodoptera litura) larvae was investigated. alpha-Terpineol was mixed in an artificial diet, and the diet was fed to the larvae (fourth-fifth instar) of S. litura. Metabolites were isolated from the frass and analyzed spectroscopically. Main metabolites were 7-hydroxy-alpha-terpineol (p-menth-1-ene-7,8-diol) and oleuropeic acid (8-hydroxy-p-menth-1-en-7-oic acid). Intestinal bacteria from the frass of larvae did not participate in the metabolism of alpha-terpineol. alpha-Terpineol was preferentially oxidized at the C-7 position (allylic methyl group) by S. litura larvae.', 'Details of the metabolism of alpha-terpineol by Pseudomonas incognita are presented. Degradation of alpha-terpineol by this organism resulted in the formation of a number of acidic and neutral metabolites. Among the acidic metabolites, beta-isopropyl pimelic acid, 1-hydroxy-4-isopropenyl-cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid, 8-hydroxycumic acid, oleuropeic acid, cumic acid, and p-isopropenyl benzoic acid have been identified. Neutral metabolites identified were limonene, p-cymene-8-ol, 2-hydroxycineole, and uroterpenol. ... /I/t appears that P. incognita degrades alpha-terpineol by at least three different routes. While one of the pathways seems to operate via oleuropeic acid, a second may be initiated through the aromatization of alpha-terpineol. The third pathway may involve the formation of limonene from alpha-terpineol and its further metabolism.', 'In a minor pathway, the endocyclic alkene of alpha-terpineol is epoxidized and then hydrolysed to yield a triol metabolite 1,2,8-trihydroxy- para-menthane, which was also reported in humans after inadvertent oral ingestion of a pine-oil disinfectant containing alpha-terpineol.', 'Metabolized primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid and excreted in urine. Oxidation of the allylic methyl group followed by hydrogenation to yield the corresponding saturated acid may occur.']",

Other metabolites were identified as 7-OHMBA, 7-MBA-trans-8,9-dihydrodiol and 7-MBA-trans-3,4-dihydrodiol, and 7-MBA-8,9,10,11-tetraol. Incubation of 7-OHMBA with C. elegans cells indicated that 7-OHMBA-trans-8,9-dihydrodiol and 7-OHMBA-trans-3,4-dihydrodiol were major metabolites. The metabolism of 7-MBA by rat liver microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats showed that the metabolites were qualitatively similar to those formed by C. elegans, except additional dihydrodiol metabolites were formed at the 5,6 and 10,11 positions. The metabolites formed were isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by comparing their chromatographic, UV-visible absorption and mass spectral properties with those of reference compounds.', '7-Methylbenz[a]anthracene (7-MBA) was metabolized stereoselectively by rat liver microsomes to form five optically active dihydrodiols as the predominant metabolites. The dihydrodiols were purified by a combination of reversed-phase and normal-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). By comparison of their circular dichroism (CD) spectra with the corresponding benz[a]anthracene (BA) dihydrodiols of known absolute stereochemistry, the major dihydrodiol enantiomers of 7-MBA have been determined to have 1R,2R-, 3R,4R- and 10R , 11R - absolute configurations, respectively. Due to their quasi- diaxial conformations, the absolute configuration of trans-5,6- and trans-8,9-dihydrodiols, the two most abundant metabolites of 7-MBA, could not be determined by simple comparisons of their circular dichroism spectra with those of the quasidi -equatorial BA 5R, 6R - and 8R , 9R -dihydrodiols. The major enantiomers of the quasi- diaxial trans-5,6- and trans-8,9-dihydrodiol metabolites of 7-MBA were determined by comparison to the CD spectrum of 7-bromo-BA 5R, 6R -dihydrodiol and by the exciton chirality method to have R,R absolute stereochemistry. This study also revealed that the circular dichroism Cotton effects of an enantiomeric dihydrodiol of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be drastically altered if the conformation (quasi- diaxial vs. quasi di-equatorial ) of the dihydrodiol is changed.', 'The metabolism of 7-ethyl (7-EBA) and 7-methylbenz[a]anthracene (7-MBA) to dihydrodiols has been compared in incubations with hepatic microsomal fractions prepared from untreated rats. Although both hydrocarbons were found to be metabolized to similar extents, the relative proportions of their diols that were detected differed. For 7-MBA, the principal diols identified were the 8,9- and 5,6-derivatives, whereas for 7-EBA the 8,9- and 1,2-diols predominated; the 5,6-diol was only present as a minor product. These results imply that the presence of the sterically bulky ethyl group at position seven in the benz[a]anthracene ring system may, when compared to the analogous methyl derivative, enhance diol formation on the angular 1,2,3,4 benzo-ring, at the expense of metabolism at the K-region.', 'The carcinogen 7-methylbenz[a]anthracene (7-MBA) is considered to be metabolically activated via its bay-region dihydrodiol-epoxide, trans-3,4-dihydro-3,4-dihydroxy-7-methyl-benz[a]anthracene 1,2-oxide (7-MBA-3,4-diol 1,2-oxide). When tested on mouse skin, a target tissue for polycylic aromatic hydrocarbon carcinogenesis, 7-ethylbenz[a]anthracene (7-EBA) was much less active than 7-MBA, and this difference may be due to differences in the pathways by which the two compounds are metabolized and activated. In the present work, the metabolism by mouse-skin microsomes of both hydrocarbons to dihydrodiols has been examined. Both were metabolized to a similar extent with the 8,9-dihydrodiols being detected as the predominant metabolites. The 3,4-, 5,6-and 10,11-dihydrodiols of 7-MBA and the 3,4- and 10, 11-dihydrodiols of 7-EBA, were also detected. 7-MBA was found to bind covalently to microsomal protein at 10 times the level of 7-EBA. The covalent binding of benz[a]anthracene (BA), 7-EBA and 7-MBA to DNA in mouse skin following topical application was determined using the 32P-postlabelling assay. The results correlated with the relative carcinogenic activities of the compounds with 7-MBA binding at five and nine times the level of 7-EBA and BA respectively. For all three hydrocarbons, the major hydrocarbon: 32P-labelled nucleoside bisphosphate, eluted in the same area of the TLC maps, suggesting the involvement of a common type of bay-region dihydrodiol-epoxide intermediate.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for 7-Methylbenz(a)anthracene (13 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']",

Selective and sensitive analytical procedures to determine etridiazole, the carboxylic acid ET-CA and the mercapturic acid ET-MA in urine were developed. The detection limit of etridiazole, applying GC with nitrogen selective detection (GC-NPD), was 36 micrograms/l urine (CV = 15.4%, n = 3).

In urine of rats orally treated with etridiazole, ET-CA and ET-MA were identified as metabolites of etridiazole, whereas in urine of humans given oral etridiazole, only ET-CA was identified. Unmetabolized etridiazole was excreted for less than 0.1% of the administered dose in rats. ET-CA, however, accounted for 22 +/- 9% of the administered dose of etridiazole in rats and for 13 +/- 6% in humans. ET-MA appeared to be a minor urinary metabolite of etridiazole.

Incubation of benzidine with isolated rat hepatocytes resulted in the appearance of diacetylbenzidine. No diacetylbenzidine was formed during incubation of benzidine with rat-liver 9000 g supernatant, unless the cofactor for the acetylation reaction, acetyl coenzyme A, was added to the incubation medium. Isolated rat hepatocytes were capable to produce diacetylbenzidine from direct black 38, direct blue 6 or direct brown 95 without supplementation with acetyl coenzyme A.

The reaction mixtures were analyzed for metabolites. Eleven oxidation products were detected in each species. In-vivo, adult houseflies and blowflies were dosed topically with H-3 labeled butacarb. The insects were then extracted by grinding them with sand and ether. Ether extracts were examined for metabolites. The water soluble fraction was also examined. Both fractions consisted of complex mixtures. The ether fraction was hydrolyzed with sodium-hydroxide, and the water soluble portion was analyzed. Six phenolic metabolites were detected. The major phenolic product was 3,5-di-tert-butylphenol, which accounted for more than half of the dose.']",

Male Syrian golden hamsters were divided into 3 groups. The first group (control) received distilled water. Animals in group 2 received either a single oral dose or an ip dose of 12.5 mg/kg of thallous malonate. The third group of animals received either a single oral dose or an ip dose of 12.35 mg/kg of thallous sulfate. By 1 hour after thallous malonate adminstration, thallium was detected in all organs. Thallium was detected only in the heart, liver and kidney in the group given thallous sulfate. By 12 hours the maximum values, except for muscle and testes, were observed in both treated groups, and the distribution patterns were similar. At this time, although the thallium concentration in the brain was less than in the other organs, thallium was rapidly deposited in the brain in both treated groups. The liver, heart, kidney and whole blood had short half-lives in the alpha phase. The beta phase in these tissues and in the brain, muscle and testes had long half lives, indicating that thallium disappeared slowly from organs. In the group receiving oral thallous malonate the urinary elmination rate constant was 0.175/day, and the fecal rate was 0.500. In the group receiving thallous malonate ip the urinary elimination rate constant was 0.086, and the fecal rate was 0.081. The urinary elimination rate constant in animals treated orally with thallous sulfate was 0.073 and the fecal rate was 0.054. Ip treatment with thallous sulfate resulted in a urinary elimination rate of 0.063 and fecal rate of 0.084.

Three dose levels of dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) (0.2, 2, or 15 mg/kg) were administered to rats and two dose levels of DCAN (2 or 15 mg/kg) to mice. Daily excreta including exhaled volatiles and radiolabeled carbon dioxide (14CO2) were analyzed for radiolabeled carbon (14C) until greater than 70% of the radioactivity was excreted. At that time the animals were sacrificed and tissues were collected. Tissues and excreta were analyzed for 14C by combustion and liquid scintillation counting. Rats administered (1-14C)DCAN excreted 62 to 73% of the 14C in 6 days, with 42 to 45% in urine, 14 to 20% in feces, and 3 to 8% as CO2.

The urine contained 64-70% of the dose, the feces contained 9-13% and about 5% was eliminated as carbon dioxide; 11-12% was retained in the tissues. The largest amount of radiolabel was found in the liver about 4% of dose, muscle and skin (about 2%) and blood and fat (about 1%). When mice were given 0.02 mmol/kg body weight (2.0 mg/kg) or 0.14 mmol/kg body weight (15 mg/kg) 2-(14)C-dichloroacetonitrile by gavage in water, 84-88% of the dose was eliminated in the urine, feces and expired air (as (14)C-carbon dioxide) within 24 hours; the urine (42-43% of dose) and expired air 31-37%) contained the most radiolabel. Nine percent of the administered radiolabel was retained in the tissues after 24 hours; most was found in the liver (about 5% of dose), and 0.5-1% of the dose was present in muscle, kidney and skin.', 'Studies with [1-14C]dichloroacetonitrile in rats and mice and [2-14C]dichloroacetonitrile in rats indicated that the substance is rapidly absorbed after oral administration in water. Excretion of radioactivity following dosing with [1-14C]dichloroacetonitrile is more rapid in mice than in rats. In mice, approximately 84% of the dose was excreted in 24 hr (67% in urine, 11% in feces, 5% as CO2), compared with 67% in rats in six days (44% in urine, 17% in feces, 6% as CO2). Excretion of [2-14C]dichloroacetonitrile radioactivity in rats accounted for about 84% of the dose within 48 hr (38% in urine, 12% in feces, 34% as CO2). The quantitative differences in the route of excretion of the two labels in rats indicate that dichloroacetonitrile is being cleaved in vivo. The 1-14Clabelled compound behaved like cyanide']","['When administered orally to rats, the haloacetonitriles (HAN) were metabolized to cyanide and excreted in the urine as thiocyanate. The extent of thiocyanate excretion was chloroacetonitrile (CAN) greater than bromochloroacetonitrile (BCAN) greater than dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN)  greater than dibromoacetonitrile (DBAN)  much greater than trichloroacetonitrile (TCAN).', 'The excretion and tissue distribution of (1-14C)dichloroacetonitrile and (2-14C)dichloroacetonitrile were studied in male Fischer 344 rats and male B6C3F1 mice. ...The differences in the route of excretion of (1-14C)DCAN compared to (2-14C)DCAN indicated that the molecule was being cleaved in the body and metabolized by different mechanisms.']",

Oral absorption of cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, oxacillin and nafcillin is delayed when the drugs are administered after meals.', 'Dicloxacillin sodium is rapidly excreted as unchanged drug in the urine by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion.', 'Differences in the elimination, distribution, and absorption of dicloxacillin and cloxacillin were studied in a group of healthy individuals with the use of a 2-compartment model. In patients on chronic intermittent hemodialysis, only dicloxacillin was investigated and the results were compared with data obtained in earlier studies on cloxacillin and flucloxacillin. In healthy volunteers the bioavailability after oral administration of 2 g dicloxacillin or 2 g cloxacillin amounted to 48.8% and 36.9% of the dose, respectively, when calculated from the area under the serum concentration-time curve, and to 74.1% and 48.5%, respectively, when calculated from the urinary excretion. Individual variation in bioavailability after oral administration was slightly lower for docloxacillin than for cloxacillin. The higher serum concentrations of dicloxacillin, as compared with cloxacillin, are also attributable to slower (renal) elimination (T 1/2: 42 and 33 min, respectively). Analysis of serum concentrations after intravenous administration of 1 and 2 g dicloxacillin to healthy subjects revealed concentration-dependent kinetics with respect ot renal elimination. In hemodialysis patients the elimination rate of dicloxacillin (T 1/2: 129 min) corresponds with the extrarenal elimination rate in healthy subjects. The bioavailability after oral administration of 1 g in patients is good (75.9% of the dose).', 'Dicloxacillin, a semisynthetic isoxazolyl penicillin antibiotic, has antimicrobial activity against a wide variety of gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of dicloxacillin after single and multiple oral dose in healthy Chinese volunteers. A single-center, open-label, randomized, two-phase study was conducted in 16 subjects. In the single-dose phase, subjects were randomly assigned to receive single doses of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g of dicloxacillin sodium capsule in a 4-way crossover design with a 5-day washout period between administrations. In the multiple-dose phase, subjects were assigned to receive 0.25 or 0.5 g every 6 hours for 3 days in a 2-way crossover design. Plasma and urine pharmacokinetic samples were assayed by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and analyzed statistically. Safety assessments were conducted throughout the study. Following a single oral dose of 0.25-2.0 g dicloxacillin sodium, the maximum plasma drug concentration (Cmax) and the corresponding values for the area under the concentration- time curve from 0 to 10 hours (AUC0-10 hr) increased in a dose-proportional manner. The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) was in the range of 1.38-1.71 hours. Dicloxacillin was excreted in its unchanged form via the kidney, with no tendency of accumulation, and varied from 38.65% to 50.10%. No appreciable accumulation of drug occurred with multiple oral doses of dicloxacillin. No serious adverse events were reported. Adverse events were generally mild. Dicloxacillin was safe and well tolerated in the volunteers and displayed linear increases in the Cmax and AUC0-10 hr values.', 'The purpose of antibiotic treatment in pregnant women is to treat the mother and/or the fetus since it is known that antibiotics administered to the mother cross the placenta and reach the fetus. A comparison of the drug concentration in maternal and fetal plasma gives an indication of the exposure of the fetus to the maternally administered antibiotics. The aim of this study was to review the literature pertaining to the placental transfer of antibiotics in man and to classify the antibiotics according to the type of transfer involved ... 3 types of placental transfers were identified. A few antibiotics cross the placenta rapidly and equilibrate in the maternal and cord plasma; this type of transfer is termed ""complete"" and include the antibiotics ampicillin, methicillin, cefmenoxime and cefotiam. Antibiotics which show incomplete transfer to the placenta where concentrations are lower in the cord than maternal plasma are said to have ""incomplete"" transfer and these include azlocillin, dicloxacillin, piperacillin, sulbenicillin, cefoxitin, amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, fosfomycin, thiamphenicol, griseofulvin, vancomycin and colistimethate. ... All examined antibiotics cross the human placenta including those with a molecular weight greater than 1000 kDa such as vancomycin and colistimethate but there are 3 distinct types of placental transfer: complete, incomplete and exceeding and most antibiotics exhibit incomplete transfer.', '/The objective of the study was/ to determine whether upregulation of P-glycoprotein is responsible for the enhanced renal clearance of dicloxacillin in patients with cystic fibrosis ... Eleven patients with cystic fibrosis and 11 age-matched healthy volunteers /were used/. All subjects received a single oral dose of dicloxacillin 500 mg alone, dicloxacillin 500 mg plus probenecid (an organic anion transport inhibitor) 1 g, and dicloxacillin 500 mg plus cyclosporine (a P-glycoprotein inhibitor) 5 mg/kg; each treatment was separated by a washout period of 48 hours. A bolus dose of iothalamate meglumine 456 mg was administered on each study day as a marker of glomerular filtration. Blood and urine samples were taken serially up to 6 hours after each dose. Pharmacokinetics of dicloxacillin and iothalamate were determined by using compartmental and noncompartmental methods. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells to measure expression of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) messenger RNA (mRNA). Genotyping for ABCB1 was performed to determine the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (exons 21 and 26). In both healthy subjects and patients with cystic fibrosis, compared with dicloxacillin alone, coadministration with probenecid produced a significantly lower renal clearance of dicloxacillin, whereas coadministration with cyclosporine resulted in no significant change; renal clearance was not significantly different between the two study groups. No correlation was found between MDR1 mRNA expression and renal clearance of dicloxacillin. The renal excretion of dicloxacillin was significantly greater in subjects with the ABCB1 exon 26 TT polymorphism when compared with subjects with the CT genotype. We found no significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of dicloxacillin between patients with cystic fibrosis and healthy volunteers. Renal clearance of dicloxacillin was significantly reduced in the presence of probenecid but not with cyclosporine, suggesting that the rate-limiting step in tubular secretion of dicloxacillin is uptake mediated by the organic anion transporter, and not P-glycoprotein inhibition.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for Dicloxacillin (22 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['Dicloxacillin is partially metabolized to active and inactive metabolites. In one study following administration of a single 500-mg oral dose of dicloxacillin, 10% of the absorbed drug was hydrolyzed to penicilloic acids which are microbiologically inactive. Dicloxacillin is also hydroxylated to a small extent to a microbiologically active metabolite which appears to be slightly less active than dicloxacillin.']","['The elimination half-life for dicloxacillin is about 0.7 hour.', '...

HBCD mixtures contain three major stereoisomers, alpha (a), beta (b), and gamma (g), at a typical ratio of 1.2:0.6:8.2. The toxicokinetic properties of the a and g isomers differ. For instance, a-HBCD has greater bioavailability and potential for accumulation in mice than g-HBCD. The present study reports comparative kinetics data for b-HBCD needed to support toxicological evaluations of HBCD mixtures. Results indicated that a single oral dose of 3mg/kg of [(14)C]-labeled b-HBCD was absorbed rapidly (> or = 85% total dose) in the female C57BL/6 mouse. The C max for b-HBCD-derived radioactivity in tissues, except adipose, was observed 3hr following gavage. Approximately 90% of the administered dose was excreted in urine and feces within 24hr, primarily as b-HBCD-derived metabolites. A portion of the dose (circa 9%) was excreted in feces as g-HBCD. Oral administration of 30 or 100mg/kg of b-HBCD resulted initially in slower rates of [(14)C] elimination; however, cumulative excretion data were similar across the dosing range 4 days postdosing. Residual concentrations of [(14)C] in tissues were highest in adipose and liver. b-HBCD-derived radioactivity accumulated in most tissues following four consecutive daily oral doses of 3mg/kg. The extent of metabolism and excretion of b-HBCD in female C57BL/6 mice was similar to that for g-HBCD. The potential for accumulation of b-HBCD-derived material in most tissues appeared to be less than for a-HBCD.']","['1,2,5,6,9,10-hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) is a brominated flame retardant consisting of a mixture of diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers that is a known omnipresent, environmental contaminant. The present study investigated the possibility of bioisomerization of HBCD stereoisomers. Therefore, mirror carps (Cyprinus carpio morpha noblis) were exposed to pure (+)- and (-)-gamma-HBCD, randomly sampled biweekly over a period of three and a half months and the fillets were subjected to enantiomer-specific determination of HBCD. Considering the background contamination of the fish at the beginning of the feeding period, significant enrichment of the respectively fed gamma-enantiomer was already detectable after two weeks of exposure. However, no significant enrichment of the respectively expected alpha-enantiomer was observed within this period. Thus, no evidence for the isomerization of HBCD stereoisomers was found in mirror carp under the applied conditions.']",

The heart, kidneys, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, testes, and urine contained no detectable levels of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, but minor amounts were found in the adipose tissue of the high dose group. Feces contained 61% and 37%, respectively, of the low and high doses given. The presence of a large quantity of octachlorodibenzo-p- dioxin in the feces compared to that in the bile 24-72 hr after a single oral dose of 58 ug octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin to bile-cannulated male Wistar rats (400 g) indicated that the dioxin present in the feces was mainly unabsorbed octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.', 'After 21 daily doses of 100 ug octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin containing 12.6 picograms (35)S-thio-heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin to male Sprague Dawley rats, the radioactivity was mainly recovered in the feces and urine, the percentages of the ingested radioactive dose being 93 (+ or - 6) and 5.2 (+ or - 0.8)% respectively. The high fecal excretion suggests poor absorption. Of the radioactive body burden, 50% was contained in the liver. The microsomal fraction contained 96.3 (+ or - 8.2)% of the hepatic radioactivity.', '...The disposition of (14)C-octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was studied in male Fischer 344 rats in order to better assess the significance of chronic environmental exposure to octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Rats were treated with 50 ug octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin/kg iv, and 50, 500, or 5,000 ug/kg orally and held in individual metabolism cages for 3 days. Additional rats treated iv were held up to 56 days to follow elimination of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin derived radioactivity and to determine terminal tissue distribution. Feces was the major route of elimination after both routes of exposure with little radioactivity ever appearing in the urine. GI absorption was nonlinear between 500 and 5,000 ug/kg, never exceeding 10% of the administered dose. Liver was the major depot, followed by adipose tissue and skin. No metabolites of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin were detected in tissues, bile, or excreta. The whole body half-life for the elimination of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was between 3 and 5 months. Repeated oral exposure resulted in linear accumulation of octachlorodibenzop-dioxin in the tissues. Thus, octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin while poorly absorbed, can accumulate upon low-dose, repeated exposure and concentrate in the liver and adipose tissue.', 'A study of dibenzo-p-dioxins concn in human milk was conducted. A total of 168 milk samples were obtained from mothers who breast fed their children. Seventy nine samples were obtained from mothers nursing their first child, 74 from mothers nursing their second child, and 15 samples were collected from mothers nursing their third or fourth child. Milk samples were obtained from a single mother 1, 5, 10 to 13, and 52 to 60 wk after delivery and analyzed for dibenzo-p-dioxins. Dibenzo-p-dioxins with 2,3,7,8-chlorine substitution were found in all samples. The mean concn of dibenzo-p-dioxins was 195 parts per trillion for octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. The dibenzo-p-dioxin concn in the samples decreased with increasing number of children who were breast fed. The concn of dibenzo-p-dioxins in the breast milk from the single mother decreased to about 30 to 40% of their initial value 52 wk after delivery. The largest decreases generally occurred 1 to 5 wk after delivery. It was concluded that dibenzo-p-dioxins residues in human milk from mothers who nurse their infants decrease from the first to the second child and with time after delivery.

The total amount of radioactivity remaining in tissues at 72 hr after a single oral administration of BMP (100 mg/kg) was less than 1% of the dose, and repeated daily dosing did not lead to retention in tissues. After intravenous administration, the radiolabel found in blood decreased rapidly. Excretion profiles were similar to those after oral administration. Parent BMP and BMP glucuronide were present in blood plasma after oral or intravenous dosing. After an intravenous dose of BMP (15 mg/kg) the hepatic BMP glucuronide was primarily exported into the bile (>50% within 6 hr), but it underwent enterohepatic recycling with subsequent elimination in the urine. These data indicate that the extensive extraction and rapid glucuronidation by the liver limits exposure of internal tissues to BMP by greatly reducing its systemic bioavailability after oral exposure.', 'Analysis of selected tissues indicated an increase in bromide content in tissues of rats ingesting 100 mg FR 1138/kg/day. At 5 mg FR 1138/kg/day, there was only a marginal increase in bromide content of some tissues, with most values in same range as controls.']","['In a 2-year bioassay 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol (BMP)  was shown to be a multisite carcinogen in rats and mice. Because glucuronidation is the key metabolic transformation of BMP by rats, in this study the in vitro hepatic glucuronidation of BMP was compared across several species. In addition, the glucuronidation activities of human intestinal microsomes and specific human hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes for BMP were determined. To explore other possible routes of metabolism for BMP, studies were conducted with rat and human hepatocytes. Incubation of hepatic microsomes with BMP in the presence of UDP-glucuronic acid resulted in the formation of a BMP monoglucuronide. The order of hepatic microsomal glucuronidation activity of BMP was rats, mice >> hamsters > monkeys >>> humans. The rate of glucuronidation by rat hepatic microsomes was 90-fold greater than that of human hepatic microsomes. Human intestinal microsomes converted BMP to BMP glucuronide at a rate even lower than that of human hepatic microsomes. Among the human UGT enzymes tested, only UGT2B7 had detectable glucuronidation activity for BMP. BMP monoglucuronide was the only metabolite formed when BMP was incubated with suspensions of freshly isolated hepatocytes from male F-344 rats or with cryopreserved human hepatocytes. Glucuronidation of BMP in human hepatocytes was extremely low. Overall, the results support in vivo studies in rats in which BMP glucuronide was the only metabolite found. The poor glucuronidation capacity of humans for BMP suggests that the pharmacokinetic profile of BMP in humans will be dramatically different from that of rodents.', 'Pentaerythritol Dibromide has known human metabolites that include (2R,3R,4R,5S,6S)-6-[2,2-Bis(bromomethyl)-3-hydroxypropoxy]-3,4,5-trihydroxyoxane-2-carboxylic acid.']",

The concentrations of sigma-HBCD in samples of porpoise (n = 59) and dolphin (n = 32) ranged from 97.2 to 6,260 ng/g lipid weight (lw) and from 447 to 45,800 ng/g lw, respectively, while those of sigma-TBECH were both roughly 2 orders of magnitude lower. A significant increasing trend of SHBCD was found in dolphin blubber over the past decade. The diastereomeric profiles exhibited an absolute predominance of alpha-HBCD (mostly >90%), while the proportions of four TBECH diastereomers in the samples appeared similar. A preferential enrichment of the (-)-enantiomers of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-HBCD was found in most blubber samples. Interestingly, the body lengths of porpoises showed a significant negative correlation with the enantiomer fractions of alpha-HBCD. Significant racemic deviations were also observed for alpha-, gamma-, and sigma-TBECH enantiomeric pairs. This is the first report of the presence of TBECH enantiomers in the environment. The estimated hazard quotient indicates that there is a potential risk to dolphins due to HBCD exposure.', ""Technical 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2 dibromoethyl)cyclohexane or tetrabromoethylcyclohexane (TBECH) used primarily as an additive flame retardant in polystyrene foams, contains two diastereoisomers, alpha- and beta- present in equimolar amounts. At temperatures in excess of 125 °C, isomerization to two other isoforms, sigma- and gamma- is possible. The recent detection of TBECH in the environment and studies suggesting that isomers are androgenic prompted us to examine the toxicokinetics and biochemical effects of one of the isomers, beta-, in a controlled laboratory environment. Juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) were exposed to three different amounts of the beta-isomer (low, medium and high) via the food followed by a period in which they were exposed to unfortified food. A fourth group of fish was exposed to unfortified food for the duration of the experiment. On days 0, 7, 14, 21, 35, 49, 56, 63, 77, 91, 105, and 133, eight fish from each treatment group were euthanized and liver, plasma, lower jaw (i.e., thyroid tissue) and gonad were collected and the remaining tissue ('whole-fish') was retained. beta-Isomer content was measured in whole-fish and in liver while estradiol (E2), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) and testosterone (T) were measured in plasma. Based on liver and gonad somatic indices, no apparent effects on liver or gonad development in fish from any of the treatment groups were observed. The bioaccumulation of beta-isomer was similar in fish from all treatment groups with steady-state occurring before the end of the uptake phase. Depuration of the beta-isomer from fish obeyed first order kinetics and there were no statistically significant differences in the depuration half life (t(1/2)) among the treatment groups: 22.5 +/- 10.4 (low), 13.5 +/- 5.9 (med) and 13.8 +/- 2.2 (high) days. Steady-state biomagnification factors were much smaller than 1 for fish in all treatment groups. Debrominated metabolites were not detected in composite liver or whole-fish extracts and there was no evidence of isomerization of the beta-isomer to other isoforms in vivo.

Uptake rates and elimination constants for five of the BFRs were calculated from measurements of their concentrations in the male fish during the exposure and elimination phases. Observed uptake efficiencies were highest for 2,4,4'-tribromodiphenyl ether (BDE 28) and 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2-dibromoethyl)cyclohexane (TBECH) and were lowest for decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 209).

Two goats were dosed with ring-labeled (14)C-asulam at 20 ppm in the diet for 7 consecutive days.

The parent compound, asulam, constituted the majority of the residues in milk (81% of total reactive reside (TRR)) and kidneys (100% of TRR) and its metabolite N4-acetylsulfanilamide constitutes the majority of residues in liver (58% of TRR). The parent was not identified in liver samples. In a previous study, sulfanilamide was found in ruminant liver and muscle, and N4-acetylasulam was found in liver, kidney, milk, muscle, and fat.', '... Laying hens were dosed with ring-labeled (14)C-asulam at 22.5 ppm in the diet for 7 consecutive days.

The liver, kidney, and spleen contained greater concentrations of (15)N incorporated into proteins than heart or muscle fractions during 72 hr following intragastric, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous administration of 15N-ammonium citrate. After the first 6 hr, during which the intragastric route gave higher values, the quantity of (15)N incorporated into liver-protein was not substantially affected by the route of administration. In most of the other tissues studied, however, (15)N incorporation tended to be least by the intragastric route, followed, in increasing order, by the intraperitoneal and subcutaneous routes. By the last route, more labelled ammonia was apparently made available to the widely distributed glutamine-synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2) system. /Ammonium citrate/']","['Results of studies on the metabolic fate of dietary ammonium citrate and intravenously-administered ammonium lactate in rats showed that urea synthesis represented a nearly constant fraction of the administered ammonia over a large concentration range. Besides glutamine and urea, labelled nitrogen also appeared in creatine, glycine, alanine, proline, histidine, arginine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid. ...The incorporation of (15)N from ammonium citrate into proteins of liver, heart, kidney, spleen, and muscle fractions of untreated and growth hormone-treated, hypophysectomized rats /was examined/, and found differences in the metabolic fate, depending on the route of administration. Subcutaneous injection facilitated the labelling of amide nitrogen, indicating extensive disposition via glutamine synthesis. In contrast, intragastric or intraperitoneal administration resulted in the labelling of arginine, glutamic acid, and other alpha-amino acids of the liver. Amide-nitrogen was labelled to a much lesser extent than by the subcutaneous route. The tissue distribution of the label also differed according to the route of entry. /Ammonium citrate/']",

The amount excreted was determined by measuring urinary levels of DMHF and DMHF glucuronide. DMHF glucuronide was synthesized and the structure elucidated by mens of (1)H, (13)C and two dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, as well as mass spectral data. Identification and quantification of DMHF glucuronide in human urine were achieved after solid phase extraction on XAD-2 using reverse-phase reverse-phase HPLC with either on-line UV/VIS or electrospray tandem mass spectrometry detection. Male and female volunteers excreted 59-69% and 81-94%, respectively, of the DMHF dose (total of free and glycosidically bound DMHF in strawberries) as DMHF glucuronide in urine within 24 hr. The amount of DMHF excretion was independent of the dose size and the ratio of free to glycosidically bound forms of DMHF in strawberry fruit. DMHF, DMHF glucoside and its 6'-O-malonyl derivative, naturally occurring in strawberries, were not detected in human urine."", 'Fragrant hydroxyfuranone and dihydroxypyranone derivatives generated in the Maillard reaction of sugars and amino acids are detected in various processed foods and have been shown active to break DNA single-strand in the in vitro studies. In the present study, absorption of 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3(2 H)-furanone (DMHF) and 4-hydroxy-2(or 5)-ethyl-5(or 2)-methyl-3(2 H)-furanone (HEMF), both found in soy sauce, into plasma after a single intraperitoneal or oral administration at doses of 0.5-1.0 g/kg to mice was examined. Both compounds appeared in plasma 15 min after intraperitoneal administration and disappeared 2 hr after the administration. They appeared in plasma 5 min after oral administration, reached maximum after 15-45 min, and gradually disappeared after 2 h, indicating that they are absorbed by the digestive tract. Both DMHF and HEMF induced micronucleated reticulocytes (MNRETs) in mouse peripheral blood in a dose-dependent manner after oral administration. The results indicate that DMHF and HEMF can cause genetic damage after oral administration.', '4-Hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone is expected to share the same metabolic fate as the primary material, i.e. conjugation with glucuronic acid and excretion in the urine.']","['4-Hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone is expected to share the same metabolic fate as the primary material, i.e. conjugation with glucuronic acid and excretion in the urine.']",

It is tasteless and colorless, was used as a poison, and is still marketed as a pesticide against rats and mice. Several long-acting warfarin derivatives-superwarfarin anticoagulants-such as brodifacoum, diphenadione, chlorophacinone, bromadiolone, are used as pesticides and can produce profound and prolonged anticoagulation. Several factors increase the risk of warfarin toxicity. However, polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 genes and drug interactions account for most of the risk for toxicity complications. Each person is unique in their degree of susceptibility to toxic agents. The toxicity interpretation and the health risk of most toxic substances are a subject of uncertainty. Genetically determined low metabolic capacity in an individual can dramatically alter the toxin and metabolite levels from those normally expected, which is crucial for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, like warfarin. Personalized approaches in interpretation have the potential to remove some of the scientific uncertainties in toxicity cases.', '/The objective was/ to assess the rate and extent of ruminal degradation of warfarin, chlorophacinone, and bromadiolone in vitro and determine the oral availability and clinical and hemostatic effects of each anticoagulant rodenticide in adult sheep...

To determine the plasma kinetics of the anticoagulants, each /of 3/ sheep received each of the anticoagulants IV or via a rumenimplanted cannula at 2-month intervals (3 rodenticide exposures/sheep). At intervals during a 240- to 360- hour period after treatment, prothrombin time (PT) was measured, plasma anticoagulant concentration was assessed, and clinical signs of rodenticide poisoning were monitored. In plasma and rumen extracts, anticoagulant concentrations were determined via high-performance liquid chromatography... In the rumen extracts, anticoagulants were slightly degraded (< 15%) over 24 hours. In vivo, oral availability of warfarin, chlorophacinone, and bromadiolone was estimated at 79%, 92%, and 88%, respectively. Although maximum PT was 80 seconds after chlorophacinone and bromadiolone treatments, no clinical signs of toxicosis were detected; PT returned to baseline values within 2 weeks...  In sheep, warfarin, chlorophacinone, and bromadiolone were not degraded in the rumen but their bioavailabilities were high after oral administration; the kinetics of these compounds in sheep and other mammals are quite similar. These data suggest that the lack of susceptibility of ruminants to these anticoagulant rodenticides cannot be explained by either ruminal degradation or the specific toxicokinetics of these anticoagulants.', 'Long-acting compounds are metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 isozymes (e.g., CYP3A4). /Long-Acting Rodenticides/']","['After intentional chlorophacinone ingestion, the plasma half-life was 6. to 22.8 days.', 'In .../a/ blood kinetics assay, 4 rats each received orally 1 mg of (14)C-labeled chlorophacinone. ...Chromatography and autoradiography demonstrated that the chlorophacinone remained unchanged in plasma, with a blood half-life of about 10 hours.', 'Half-life in blood /of rats/  0.4 days...Half-life in liver /of rats/ less than 2 days. /From table/']"

Metabolites were formed by incubation of 5-methylchrysene with the 9000 from Aroclor-treated rat livers. With the use of reverse-phase columns, the metabolites were resolved into 9 peaks, A to I. Each peak was collected and tested for mutagenicity with activation. Significant mutagenic activity was observed primarily in peak E and to a lesser extent in peak D. None of the other metabolites showed significant mutagenic activity. The major mutagenic metabolite (peak E) was identified as 1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-5-methylchrysene (7.0% from 5-methylchrysene); peak D was 7,8-dihydro-7,8-dihydroxy-5-methylchrysene (2.6% from 5-methylchrysene). Other metabolites included 9,10-dihydro-9,10-dihydroxy-5-methylchrysene, 9-hydroxy-5-methylchrysene, 7-hydroxy-5-methylchrysene, 1-hydroxy-5-methylchrysene and 5-hydroxymethylchrysene. These results indicate that 1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-5-methylchrysene is a major proximate mutagen of 5-methylchrysene.', '1,2- & 7,8-Dihydrodiols were the major metabolites of 5-methylchrysene, 7 small amounts of the 9,10-dihydrodiol were also formed following incubation of the compound with rat-liver preparations. Other metabolites detected include 1-, 7- & 9-hydroxy-5-methylchrysene & 5-hydroxymethylchrysene.', 'The metabolic activation in mouse skin of the strong carcinogen, 5-methylchrysene (5-MeC) was compared to that of the inactive compound, 6-nitro-5-methylchrysene (6-NO2-5-MeC). Metabolites of 6-NO2-5-MeC, formed using rat liver homogenates, were identified based on their spectral properties and were used as markers for studies performed in vivo. In mouse epidermis in vivo, the identified metabolites of 6-NO2-5-MeC were trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-6-nitro-5-methylchrysene (6-NO2-5-MeC-1,2-diol), the precursor to a bay region dihydrodiol epoxide, trans-9,10-dihydro-9,10-dihydroxy-6-nitro-5-methylchrysene, and 6-nitro-5-hydroxymethylchrysene. The levels of 6-NO2-5-MeC-1,2-diol formed in mouse epidermis from 6-NO2-5-MeC were greater than those of the proximate carcinogen trans-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxy-5-methylchrysene (5-MeC-1,2-diol) formed from 5-MeC. The further metabolism of 6-NO2-5-MeC-1,2-diol was examined in mouse epidermis under conditions similar to those described previously for 5-MeC-1,2-diol. The extents of formation of 1,2,3,4-tetraols from both dihydrodiols were similar. The chromatographic patterns of DNA adducts formed in mouse epidermis from 6-NO2-5-MeC and 5-MeC were qualitatively similar; however, the extent of formation of DNA adducts from 5-MeC was 15-fold greater than from 6-NO2-5-MeC. The reactions between calf thymus DNA and the bay region 1,2-diol-3,4-epoxides of 5-MeC and 6-NO2-5-MeC were compared; the levels of adducts formed from the bay region diol epoxide of 5-MeC were about four times greater than those formed from the bay region diol epoxide of 6-NO2-5-MeC. The results indicate that the relatively low DNA binding in vivo of 6-NO2-5-MeC may be responsible for its apparent lack of tumorigenicity compared to 5-MeC. It is likely that nitro substitution at the 6-position of 5-MeC interferes with the structural requirements of the 1,2-diol-3,4-epoxide which are necessary for specific DNA interactions.', 'We have investigated the metabolism of chrysene (CHR) and 5-methychyrsene (5-MeCHR) by Shasta rainbow trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss) and Long Evans rat liver microsomes to assess the effect of a non-benzo ring methyl substituent on the reactions involved in the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Trout as well as rat liver microsomes metabolized both CHR and 5-MeCHR at essentially similar rates, indicating that the methyl substituent does not alter the substrate specificity of the cytochrome P450(s) involved in the metabolism of the two PAHs. Dihydrodiols were the major CHR metabolites formed by both trout and rat liver microsomes, whereas the trout liver microsomes formed a considerably higher proportion of 5-MeCHR phenols compared to diols, indicating that 5-methyl substitution alters the substrate specificity of trout microsomal epoxide hydrolase for 5-MeCHR epoxides. Unlike trout liver microsomes, rat liver microsomes formed a much greater proportion of 5-MeCHR diols compared to 5-MeCHR phenols, suggesting that 5-MeCHR epoxides are better substrates for the microsomal epoxide hydrolase present in rat liver than for the enzyme in trout liver. Both trout and rat liver microsomes are more efficient at attacking the bay-region bond versus the non-bay-region double bond in chrysene. In contrast the reverse is true in the case of 5-MeCHR, indicating that a non-benzo ring methyl substituent alters the regioselectivity of the enzymes involved in the oxidative metabolism of PAHs.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for 5-Methylchrysene (10 total), please visit the HSDB record page.', '5-methylchrysene has known human metabolites that include 5-Methyl-1,2-dihydrochrysene-1,2-diol.']",

After the intraperitoneal administrations of FNT to pigmented hairy rats (5 mg/kg/day, 10 days, n = 3), concentrations of FNT and its metabolite, AP, in the rat hair newly grown over 4 weeks were compared with area under the concentration versus time curves (AUCs) of the drugs in the rat plasma.

The ratios of the hair concentrations to the AUCs of FNT and AP were 0.93 and 0.22, respectively. This suggests that FNT tends to be highly incorporated into hair from blood.

In addition, it was found that the concentrations of FNT were 1.2 to 2.7 times greater than those of AP in the human hair samples, except for one sample, although FNT rapidly disappeared from the urine compared with AP. It was concluded that hair would be a good specimen for disclosure of drug history of FNT and for discrimination between FNT use and AP abuse.']","['Metabolic fate of 7-[2-(alpha-methylphenylethylamino)ethyl]theophylline hydrochloride (fenetylline) was investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats and three male volunteers. Six metabolites were identified in the rat urine as amphetamine (AP), p-hydroxy-AP, acetylaminoethyl-theophylline(TP), aminoethyl-TP, hydroxyethyl-TP and carboxymethyl-TP by comparison of their spectral properties and H.P.L.C. and G.L.C. characteristics with those of authentic samples. All these metabolites was also detected in the urine of humans receiving fenetylline. Quantification of these metabolites using H.P.L.C. and G.L.C. showed that carboxymethyl-TP, p-hydroxy-AP and acetylaminoethyl-TP were the major metabolites in 0-24 hr rat urine at 13.7%, 11.2% and 9.3% of dose, respectively. In men, carboxymethyl-TP(39-43% dose) and AP(23-33% dose) were the major metabolites in 0-48 hr urine. These results suggest that fenetylline metabolism proceeds via oxidative cleavage at two different sites to produce aminoethyl-TP and AP, respectively. The pathway producing AP predominates, in both man and rat, but is more predominant in the former.', 'Fenetylline is metabolized in humans on two pathways. In addition to previously described degradation to amphetamine and 7-oxyethyltheophylline fenetylline undergoes moreover oxydative N-dealkylation to yield 7-aminoethyltheophylline and phenylacetone.', 'In the fenetylline molecule, theophylline is covalently linked with amphetamine via an alkyl chain. The inclusion of amphetamine and results from early metabolic studies have led to speculation that fenetylline may be merely a prodrug for amphetamine and/or theophylline. Although previous studies are not consistent with this hypothesis, additional studies were conducted to comparatively evaluate the profiles of activity exhibited by fenetylline and its two postulated primary metabolites, (+/-)-amphetamine and theophylline. Investigations were also initiated using newly developed high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques to further characterize the metabolic pattern that fenetylline undergoes and to examine the relationship between plasma pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic actions of the drug. Fenetylline inhibits activity associated with amphetamine in certain test systems, an effect similar to that previously observed with fenfluramine. Only small amounts of the amphetamine theoretically available in the fenetylline molecule are released. Pharmacodynamic activity associated with fenetylline administration is more closely tied to plasma levels of the parent compound than to any (+/-)-amphetamine produced.', 'The interpretation of methamphetamine and amphetamine positive test results in biological samples is a challenge to clinical and forensic toxicology for several reasons. The effects of pH and dilution of urine samples and the knowledge about legitimate and illicit sources have to be taken into account. Besides a potentially legal prescription of amphetamines, many substances metabolize to methamphetamine or amphetamine in the body: amphetaminil, benzphetamine, clobenzorex, deprenyl, dimethylamphetamine, ethylamphetamine, famprofazone, fencamine, fenethylline, fenproporex, furfenorex, mefenorex, mesocarb, and prenylamine. Especially the knowledge of potential origins of methamphetamine and amphetamine turns out to be very important to prevent a misinterpretation of the surrounding circumstances and to prove illegal drug abuse.

Pretreating male rats with unlabelled Green S or Brilliant Blue FCF in the diet (100 or 30 mg/kg day, respectively) for 21 days prior to dosing with (14)C-labelled coloring had no effect on the route of excretion or the time taken to eliminate all of the label. Similarly male mice and guinea-pigs excreted in the feces all of a single oral dose of Green S or Brilliant Blue FCF. The lack of absorption and metabolism of the labelled dye in the gastro-intestinal tract of all three species investigated was confirmed by studies using isolated loops of small intestine. It was shown that no radioactivity was taken up by the fetuses of pregnant rats given (14)C-labelled Green S or Brilliant Blue FCF.', 'Female Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single dose (0.27 mg; 1.74 uCi) of the (14)C-labelled coloring by gavage.

Mean fecal excretion was 97.28% and the total recovery of administered radioactivity was 99.38%. Intestinal absorption (14)C-FD & C Blue No. 1 in intact rats averaged only 0.27% (91% recovery), while biliary excretion in bile-duct cannulated animals averaged 1.32% of the dose. Thin-layer chromatography of urine and bile samples revealed that about 95% of excreted radioactivity was unaltered FD & C Blue No. 1 and that about 5% was an unidentified metabolite or degradation product of FD & C Blue No. 1. The results show that FD & C Blue No.1 is poorly absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract, and undergoes subsequent rapid and complete biliary excretion /of the absorbed compound/.', '... Less than 0.05% of a labeled dose of 3 mg/kg bw was excreted in the bile of rats over a 5-hour period.

(See all compounds classified as Anti-Bacterial Agents.)'],"['Macrolides become widely distributed in tissues, and concentrations are about the same as in plasma, or even higher in some instances. They actually accumulate within many cells, including macrophages, in which they may be > or = 20 times the plasma concentration. This accumulation accounts in part for the long dosing interval that characterizes some macrolides (eg, tilmicosin). ... Macrolides tend to concentrate in the spleen, liver, kidneys, and particularly the lungs. They enter pleural and ascitic fluids but not the CSF (only 2-13% of plasma concentration unless the meninges are inflamed). They concentrate in the bile and milk. Up to 75% of the dose is bound to plasma proteins, and they bind to alpha1-acid glycoproteins rather than to albumin. /Macrolides/', 'Macrolides are readily absorbed from the GI tract if not inactivated by gastric acid. ... Plasma levels peak within 1-2 hours in most cases, although absorption patterns may be erratic due to the presence of food and may depend on the salt or ester used. Absorption from the ruminoreticulum is usualy delayed and is unreliable. /Macrolides/', 'Macrolide antibiotics and their metabolites are excreted mainly in the bile (> 60%) and often undergo enterohepatic cycling. Urinary clearance may be slow and variable (often <10%) but my represent a more significant route of elimination after parenteral administration. The concentration of macrolides in milk often is several times greater than in plasma, especially in mastitis. /Macrolide/', 'The pharmacokinetics of oleandomycin (OLD) after intravenous and oral administration, both alone and after intramuscular pretreatment with metamizole or dexamethasone, were studied in healthy dogs. After intravenous injection of oleandomycin alone (10 mg/kg as bolus), the elimination half-life (t 1/2 beta, volume of distribution (Vd, area), body clearance (ClB) and area under the concentration time curve (AUC) were 1.60 hr, 1.11 L/kg. 7.36 (ml/kg)/min and 21.66 ug hr/ml, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences following pretreatment with metamizole or dexamethasone. After oral administration of oleandomycin alone, the t 1/2 beta, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax), time of Cmax (tmax), mean absorption time and absolute bioavailability (Fabs) were 1.6 hr, 5.34 ug/ml, 1.5 hr, 1.34 hr and 84.29%, respectively. Pretreatment with metamizole caused a significantly decreased value for Cmax (2.93 ug/ml) but the mean absorption time value (2.23 hr) was significantly increased. Statistically significant changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of oleandomycin following oral administration were also observed as a result of pretreatment with dexamethasone. The Cmax was increased (8.24 ug/ml) and the tmax (0.5 hr) and mean absorption time (0.45 hr) were lower.', 'Knowledge of the disposition of macrolides in a single animal species has been insufficient for the prediction of the pharmacokinetics of macrolides in humans. To better understand the species differences in the pharmacokinetics of macrolide antibiotics, the disposition of erythromycin, oleandomycin, and tylosin in several mammalian species was examined. Generally, the serum concentration versus time profiles of these drugs after intravenous administration were described by two-compartment kinetic models and were similar within each species. These drugs were rapidly cleared, resulting in terminal half-lives of less than 2 h. Comparison of their pharmacokinetics showed greater variation in antibiotic disposition among animal species than noted for the differences within a species. When the pharmacokinetic data was fitted to an allometric model, the logarithms of volume of distribution, clearance, and half-life were linearly related to the logarithms of body weight. From these relationships, the human pharmacokinetics of erythromycin and oleandomycin were extrapolated and found to approximate observed human pharmacokinetics.']","['Metabolic inactivation of the macrolides is usually extensive, but the relative proportion depends on the route of administration and th particular antibiotic. ... /Macrolides/']","['The plasma half-lives of macrolides usually are 1-3 hr, ... /Macrolides/']"

Azatadine is in the same class of drugs as chlorpromazine (Thorazine) and trifluoperazine (Stelazine); however, unlike the other drugs in this class, azatadine is not used clinically as an anti-psychotic. Antihistamines antagonize the vasodilator effect of endogenously released histamine, especially in small vessels, and mitigate the effect of histamine which results in increased capillary permeability and edema formation. As consequences of these actions, antihistamines antagonize the physiological manifestations of histamine release in the nose following antigen-antibody interaction, such as congestion related to vascular engorgement, mucosal edema, and profuse, watery secretion, and irritation and sneezing resulting from histamine action on afferent nerve terminals.']","['Drugs that selectively bind to but do not activate histamine H1 receptors, thereby blocking the actions of endogenous histamine.
