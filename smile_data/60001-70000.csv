It blocks leukotriene synthesis by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase, an enzyme of the eicosanoid synthesis pathway. Current data indicates that asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways involving the production and activity of several endogenous inflammatory mediators, including leukotrienes. Sulfido-peptide leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, also known as the slow-releasing substances of anaphylaxis) and LTB4, a chemoattractant for neutrophils and eosinophils, are derived from the initial unstable product of arachidonic acid metabolism, leukotriene A4 (LTA4), and can be measured in a number of biological fluids including bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from asthmatic patients. In humans, pretreatment with zileuton attenuated bronchoconstriction caused by cold air challenge in patients with asthma.']","['Anti-inflammatory agents that are non-steroidal in nature. In addition to anti-inflammatory actions, they have analgesic, antipyretic, and platelet-inhibitory actions. They act by blocking the synthesis of prostaglandins by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, which converts arachidonic acid to cyclic endoperoxides, precursors of prostaglandins.

In all cases, the reduction was enantioselective for the (+)-(R)-enantiomer, although the dog showed lower stereoselectivity, especially after iv administration. An approximate enantiomeric ratio (+/-) of 90:10 was found in rat and human urine. The contribution of further metabolism to this enantiomeric ratio was considered small as preliminary studies showed that oxidation of the enantiomeric alcohols by human liver microsomes demonstrated only minor stereoselectivity. Further evidence for the role of stereoselective reduction in man was obtained from in vitro studies, where dolasetron was incubated with human whole blood. The enantiomeric composition of reduced dolasetron formed in human whole blood was the same as that found in human urine after administration of dolasetron. Enantioselectivity was not due to differences in the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of enantiomers, as iv or oral administration of rac-reduced dolasetron to rats and dogs lead to the recovery, in urine, of essentially the same enantiomeric composition as the dose administered. It is fortuitous that the (+)-(R)-enantiomer is predominantly formed by carbonyl reductase, as it is the more active compound.']","['Following oral administration hydrodolasetron has a elimination half-life of 8.1 hours (mean).

DNA topoisomerases are enzymes in the cell nucleus that regulate DNA topology (3-dimensional conformation) and facilitate nuclear processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and repair. During these processes, DNA topoisomerase I creates reversible single-stranded breaks in double-stranded DNA, allowing intact single DNA strands to pass through the break and relieve the topologic constraints inherent in supercoiled DNA. The 3'-DNA terminus of the broken DNA strand binds covalently with the topoisomerase enzyme to form a catalytic intermediate called a cleavable complex. After DNA is sufficiently relaxed and the strand passage reaction is complete, DNA topoisomerase reattaches the broken DNA strands to form the unaltered topoisomers that allow transcription to proceed. Topotecan interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells can be affected by the medicine, other effects may also occur. Unlike irinotecan, topotecan is found predominantly in the inactive carboxylate form at neutral pH and it is not a prodrug.""]",['Compounds that inhibit the activity of DNA TOPOISOMERASE I.

In a mass balance/excretion study in 4 patients with solid tumors, the overall recovery of total topotecan and its N-desmethyl metabolite in urine and feces over 9 days averaged 73.4 ± 2.3% of the administered IV dose. Fecal elimination of total topotecan accounted for 9 ± 3.6% while fecal elimination of N-desmethyl topotecan was 1.7 ± 0.6%.', 'The pharmacokinetics of topotecan have been extensively studied in patients with normal renal function and there is one study of patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. However, the effect of hemodialysis on topotecan disposition has not been reported. The objective of this study was to characterize the disposition of topotecan in a patient with severe renal insufficiency receiving hemodialysis. Topotecan lactone disposition was characterized in a patient on and off hemodialysis. The topotecan lactone clearance determined after administration of topotecan alone and with hemodialysis was 5.3 L/hr per sq m vs 20.1 L/hr per sq m respectively. At 30 min after the completion of hemodialysis, the topotecan plasma concentration obtained was greater than that measured at the end of hemodialysis (i.e. 8.0 ng/mL vs 4.9 ng/mL), suggesting a rebound effect. The topotecan terminal half-life off dialysis was 13.6 hr, compared with an apparent half-life determined during hemodialysis of 3.0 hr. These results demonstrate that topotecan plasma clearance while on hemodialysis increased approximately fourfold. Hemodialysis may be an effective systemic clearance process for topotecan and should be considered in selected clinical situations (e.g. inadvertent overdose, severe renal dysfunction).', 'In lactating rats receiving IV topotecan at a dosage of 4.72 mg/sq m, high concentrations of the drug (i.e., up to 48 times higher than plasma concentrations) were distributed into milk.

Following IV administration, about 74% of a topotecan dose is excreted, mostly unchanged in urine (51%) and feces (18%) within 9 days; excretion of N-desmethyl topotecan in urine is approximately 3% and in feces is approximately 2%. O-Glucuronide metabolites of topotecan and N-desmethyl topotecan also have been detected in urine following oral and IV (less than 2% of the administered IV dose) administration of the drug.', 'No substantial gender-related differences in pharmacokinetics were reported in patients receiving oral topotecan.

More specifically, it blocks the progression of cells through the G1/S-phase boundary. Gemcitabine demonstrated cytotoxic effects against a broad range of cancer cell lines _in vitro_. It displayed schedule-dependent antitumour activity in various animal models and xenografts from human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer. Therefore, the antineoplastic effects of gemcitabine are enhanced through prolonged infusion time rather than higher dosage. Gemcitabine inhibited the growth of human xenografts from carcinoma of the lung, pancreas, ovaries, head and neck, and breast. In mice, gemcitabine inhibited the growth of human tumour xenografts from the breast, colon, lung or pancreas by 69 to 99%. In clinical trials of advanced NSCLC, gemcitabine monotherapy produced objective response rates ranging from 18 to 26%, with a median duration of response ranging from 3.3 to 12.7 months. Overall median survival time was 6.2 to 12.3 months. The combined use of cisplatin and gemcitabine produced better objective response rates compared to monotherapy. In patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, objective response rates in patients ranged from 5.to 12%, with a median survival duration of 3.9 to 6.3 months. In Phase II trials involving patients with metastatic breast cancer, treatment with gemcitabine alone or with adjuvant chemotherapies resulted in response rate ranging from 13 to 42% and median survival duration ranging from 11.5 to 17.8 months.

Values for C(max) and AUC were similar in fed and fasted patients and no significant differences were observed. The safety profile of oral vinorelbine observed in this limited number of patients appears to be comparable to that usually reported for vinorelbine, the main toxicity being neutropenia. Only one episode of febrile neutropenia was reported. The main nonhematological toxicities encountered were gastrointestinal, consisting of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation. A tendency for a lower incidence of vomiting was suggested when oral vinorelbine was administered after a standard breakfast.

Dyslipidemia describes an elevation of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides or both as well as to the presence of low levels of high-density lipoprotein. This condition represents an increased risk for the development of atherosclerosis.   Atorvastatin is indicated, in combination with dietary modifications, to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with cardiac risk factors and/or abnormal lipid profiles.  Atorvastatin can be used as a preventive agent for myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and angina, in patients without coronary heart disease but with multiple risk factors and in patients with type 2 diabetes without coronary heart disease but multiple risk factors.  Atorvastatin may be used as a preventive agent for non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for congestive heart failure and angina in patients with coronary heart disease.  Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.']","['Atorvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent that reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease, and high ratios are associated with a higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.   Elevated cholesterol levels (and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) are an important risk factor for the development of CVD. Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin reduces LDL-C and total cholesterol by 36-53%. In patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia, atorvastatin reduced the levels of intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol. It has also been suggested that atorvastatin can limit the extent of angiogenesis, which can be useful in the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma.  **Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis**  Atorvastatin, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is associated with a risk of drug-induced myopathy characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness in conjunction with elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK). Myopathy often manifests as rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria. The risk of statin-induced myopathy is dose-related, and the symptoms of myopathy are typically resolved upon drug discontinuation. Results from observational studies suggest that 10-15% of people taking statins may experience muscle aches at some point during treatment.  **Liver Dysfunction**  Statins, like some other lipid-lowering therapies, have been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent elevations (> 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] occurring on two or more occasions) in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. This effect appears to be dose-related.  **Endocrine Effects**  Statins are associated with a risk of increased serum HbA1c and glucose levels. An _in vitro_ study demonstrated a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human pancreatic islet β cells following treatment with atorvastatin. Moreover, insulin secretion rates decreased relative to control.  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfere with cholesterol synthesis and may theoretically interfere with the production of adrenal and/or gonadal steroids. Clinical studies with atorvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have suggested that these agents do not affect plasma cortisol concentrations, basal plasma testosterone concentration, or adrenal reserve. However, the effect of statins on male fertility has not been fully investigated. The effects of statins on the pituitary-gonadal axis in premenopausal women are unknown.  **Cardiovascular**  Significant decreases in circulating ubiquinone levels in patients treated with atorvastatin and other statins have been observed. The clinical significance of a potential long-term statin-induced deficiency of ubiquinone has not been established. It has been reported that a decrease in myocardial ubiquinone levels could lead to impaired cardiac function in patients with borderline congestive heart failure.  **Lipoprotein A**  In some patients, the beneficial effect of lowered total cholesterol and LDL-C levels may be partly blunted by the concomitant increase in Lp(a) lipoprotein concentrations. Present knowledge suggests the importance of high Lp(a) levels as an emerging risk factor for coronary heart disease. Further studies have demonstrated statins affect Lp(a) levels differently in patients with dyslipidemia depending on their apo(a) phenotype; statins increase Lp(a) levels exclusively in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotype.']","['Compounds that inhibit HYDROXYMETHYLGLUTARYL COA REDUCTASES.

After the administration of a dose of 40 mg, its peak plasma concentration of 28 ng/ml is reached 1-2 hours after initial administration with an AUC of about 200 ng∙h/ml. Atorvastatin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the wall of the gut and the liver, resulting in an absolute oral bioavailability of 14%. Plasma atorvastatin concentrations are lower (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration.  Administration of atorvastatin with food results in prolonged Tmax and a reduction in Cmax and AUC.  Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) is a membrane-bound protein that plays an important role in the absorption of atorvastatin. Evidence from pharmacogenetic studies of c.421C>A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene for BCRP has demonstrated that individuals with the 421AA genotype have reduced functional activity and 1.72-fold higher AUC for atorvastatin compared to study individuals with the control 421CC genotype. This has important implications for the variation in response to the drug in terms of efficacy and toxicity, particularly as the BCRP c.421C>A polymorphism occurs more frequently in Asian populations than in Caucasians.

In vitro studies suggest the importance of Lipitor metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of Lipitor in humans following co-administration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme. In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.', 'The active forms of all marketed hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors share a common dihydroxy heptanoic or heptenoic acid side chain. In this study, we present evidence for the formation of acyl glucuronide conjugates of the hydroxy acid forms of simvastatin (SVA), atorvastatin (AVA), and cerivastatin (CVA) in rat, dog, and human liver preparations in vitro and for the excretion of the acyl glucuronide of SVA in dog bile and urine. Upon incubation of each statin (SVA, CVA or AVA) with liver microsomal preparations supplemented with UDP-glucuronic acid, two major products were detected. Based on analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography, UV spectroscopy, and/or liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry analysis, these metabolites were identified as a glucuronide conjugate of the hydroxy acid form of the statin and the corresponding delta-lactone. By means of an LC-NMR technique, the glucuronide structure was established to be a 1-O-acyl-beta-D-glucuronide conjugate of the statin acid. The formation of statin glucuronide and statin lactone in human liver microsomes exhibited modest intersubject variability (3- to 6-fold; n = 10). Studies with expressed UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) revealed that both UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 were capable of forming the glucuronide conjugates and the corresponding lactones for all three statins. Kinetic studies of statin glucuronidation and lactonization in liver microsomes revealed marked species differences in intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) values for SVA (but not for AVA or CVA), with the highest CL(int) observed in dogs, followed by rats and humans. Of the statins studied, SVA underwent glucuronidation and lactonization in human liver microsomes, with the lowest CL(int) (0.4 uL/min/mg of protein for SVA versus approximately 3 uL/min/mg of protein for AVA and CVA). Consistent with the present in vitro findings, substantial levels of the glucuronide conjugate (approximately 20% of dose) and the lactone form of SVA [simvastatin (SV); approximately 10% of dose] were detected in bile following i.v. administration of [(14)C]SVA to dogs. The acyl glucuronide conjugate of SVA, upon isolation from an in vitro incubation, underwent spontaneous cyclization to SV. Since the rate of this lactonization was high under conditions of physiological pH, the present results suggest that the statin lactones detected previously in bile and/or plasma following administration of SVA to animals or of AVA or CVA to animals and humans, might originate, at least in part, from the corresponding acyl glucuronide conjugates. Thus, acyl glucuronide formation, which seems to be a common metabolic pathway for the hydroxy acid forms of statins, may play an important, albeit previously unrecognized, role in the conversion of active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to their latent delta-lactone forms.', 'The genetic variation underlying atorvastatin (ATV) pharmacokinetics was evaluated in a Mexican population. Aims of this study were: 1) to reveal the frequency of 87 polymorphisms in 36 genes related to drug metabolism in healthy Mexican volunteers, 2) to evaluate the impact of these polymorphisms on ATV pharmacokinetics, 3) to classify the ATV metabolic phenotypes of healthy volunteers, and 4) to investigate a possible association between genotypes and metabolizer phenotypes.

Irinotecan is a semisynthetic derivative of camptothecin. Camptothecins interact specifically with topoisomerase I, an enzyme in the cell nucleus that regulates DNA topology and facilitates nuclear processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and repair. During these processes, topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks, allowing single DNA strands to pass through the break. The 3'-DNA terminus of the broken DNA strands bind covalently with the topoisomerase enzyme to form a catalytic intermediate called a cleavable complex. After the DNA is sufficiently relaxed and the strand passage reaction is complete, DNA topoisomerase reattaches the broken DNA strands to form the chemically unaltered topoisomers that allow transcription to proceed. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either Irinotecan or SN-38. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-strand breaks. The precise contribution of SN-38 to the activity of irinotecan in humans is not known.

Removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a 2- to 3-fold rise in plasma renin and consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients. Minimal decreases in plasma aldosterone were observed after administration of valsartan.  In multiple-dose studies in hypertensive patients, valsartan had no notable effects on total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, fasting serum glucose, or uric acid.  **Hypotension**   Excessive hypotension was rarely seen (0.1%) in patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with valsartan alone. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur. This condition should be corrected prior to administration of valsartan, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision.   Caution should be observed when initiating therapy in patients with heart failure. Patients with heart failure given valsartan commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, but discontinuation of therapy because of continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed. In controlled trials in heart failure patients, the incidence of hypotension in valsartan-treated patients was 5.5% compared to 1.8% in placebo-treated patients.   If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.   **Impaired Renal Function**  Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on valsartan. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on valsartan.   **Hyperkalemia**  Some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium. These effects are usually minor and transient, and they are more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.

As suggested by the quantity of metabolites, ziprasidone is metabolized through several different pathways. Ziprasidone is sequentially oxidized to ziprasidone sulfoxide and ziprasidone sulfone, and oxidative N-dealkylation of ziprasidone produces OX-COOH and BITP. OX-COOH undergoes phase II metabolism to yield a glucuronidated metabolite while BITP is sequentially oxidized into BITP sulfoxide, BITP sulfone, then BITP sulfone lactam. Ziprasidone can also undergo reductive cleavage and methylation to produce S-Methyl-dihydro-ziprasidone and then further oxidation to produce S-Methyl-dihydro-ziprasidone-sulfoxide. Finally dearylation of ziprasidone produces OX-P, and the process of hydration and oxidation transforms the parent drug into dihydro-ziprasidone-sulfone.

After oral administration, capecitabine is first metabolized to 5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5'-DFCR) by carboxylesterase (CES), then 5'-DFCR is converted to 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR) by cytidine deaminase. 5'-DFUR is activated to 5-FU by thymidine phosphorylase. Although high activities of drug metabolizing enzymes are expressed in human liver, the involvement of the liver in capecitabine metabolism is not fully understood. In this study, the metabolism of capecitabine in human liver was investigated in vitro. 5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR, and 5-FU formation from capecitabine were investigated in human liver S9, microsomes, and cytosol in the presence of the inhibitor of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine. 5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR, and 5-FU were formed from capecitabine in cytosol and in the combination of microsomes and cytosol. Only 5'-DFCR formation was detected in microsomes. The apparent K(m) and V(max) values of 5-FU formation catalyzed by cytosol alone and in combination with microsomes were 8.1 mM and 106.5 pmol/min/mg protein, and 4.0 mM and 64.0 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. The interindividual variability in 5'-DFCR formation in microsomes and cytosol among 14 human liver samples was 8.3- and 12.3-fold, respectively. Capecitabine seems to be metabolized to 5-FU in human liver. 5'-DFCR formation was exhibited in cytosol with large interindividual variability, although CES is located in microsomes in human liver. In the present study, it has been clarified that the cytosolic enzyme would be important in 5'-DFCR formation, as is CES."", ""Capecitabine (Xeloda; CAP) is a recently developed oral antineoplastic prodrug of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with enhanced tumor selectivity. Previous studies have shown that CAP activation follows a pathway with three enzymatic steps and two intermediary metabolites, 5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5'-DFCR) and 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR), to form 5-FU preferentially in tumor tissues. In the present work,  all fluorinated compounds present in liver, bile, and perfusate medium of isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL) and in liver, plasma, kidneys, bile, and urine of healthy rats /were investigated/. Moreover, data obtained from rat urine were compared with those from mice and human urine. According to a low cytidine deaminase activity in rats, 5'-DFCR was by far the main product in perfusate medium from IPRL and plasma and urine from rats. Liver and circulating 5'-DFCR in perfusate and plasma equilibrated at the same concentration value in the range 25 to 400 microM, which supports the involvement of es-type nucleoside transporter in the liver. 5'-DFUR and alpha-fluoro-beta-ureidopropionic acid (FUPA) + alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL) were the main products in urine of mice, making up 23 to 30% of the administered dose versus 3 to 4% in rat. In human urine, FUPA + FBAL represented 50% of the administered dose, 5'-DFCR 10%, and 5'-DFUR 7%. Since fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy gives an overview of all the fluorinated compounds present in a sample, we observed the following unreported metabolites of CAP: 1) 5-fluorocytosine and its hydroxylated metabolite, 5-fluoro-6-hydroxycytosine, 2) fluoride ion, 3) 2-fluoro-3-hydroxypropionic acid and fluoroacetate, and 4) a glucuroconjugate of 5'-DFCR."", 'Fluorouracil is catabolized to dihydrofluorouracil (FUH2), a much less toxic metabolite, by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase.

Although the 58 kDa protein showed 99% identity to that of the deduced amino acid sequence of a cDNA reported to correspond to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-alpha, it did not have phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activity. It was concluded that the reported cDNA of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-alpha actually encoded for the 58 kDa endoplasmic reticulum protein of unknown function. Other researchers have come to the same conclusion and have shown that the 58 kDa protein has protein disulfide-isomerase and protease activities. We now report that patients with halothane hepatitis have serum antibodies that react with both purified trifluoroacetylated and native rat liver 58 kDa proteins. These results suggest that when patients are exposed to halothane a human liver orthologue of the rat liver trifluoroacetylated-58 kDa protein is formed. In certain patients, this protein may become immunogenic and lead to the formation of specific antibodies and or specific T-cells, which may react with both trifluoroacetylated and native 58 kDa proteins, and ultimately be responsible, at least in part, for the hepatitis caused by halothane.', 'The anesthetic halothane is bioactivated by the liver cytochrome P450 system to the reactive intermediate, trifluoroacetyl chloride, which can acylate liver protein. Cytosolic glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was identified as a major target for protein adduct formation in guinea pig liver slices exposed to halothane. To determine if GST is also a target in vivo, male Hartley guinea pigs were exposed to 1% halothane in 40% O2 for 4 hr. At 10 hr post exposure, livers were removed and microsomal and cytosolic fractions prepared. Past studies have shown these conditions resulted in maximal covalent binding of halothane intermediates to hepatic protein. Protein was isolated by ethanol precipitation and washed with trichloroacetic acid to remove unbound metabolites. Cytosolic GST was isolated by gel filtration and S-hexyl-glutathione affinity chromatography to electrophoretic purity. Protein adducts were quantified using a covalently bound fluorine assay. Covalent binding of a halothane intermediate to cytosolic and microsomal protein was determined as 2.0 +/- 0.4 and 13.2 +/- 2.3 nmol F/mg protein, respectively. Liver glutathione depletion by buthionine sulfoximine pretreatment produced an increase in covalent binding only to cytosolic proteins (3.3 +/- 0.4 nmol F/mg protein). Adduct formation to cytosolic GST was determined to be 4.7 +/- 1.6 nmol F/mg protein. Glutathione-S-transferase is a target for covalent modification in the liver following an inhalation exposure to halothane.', 'Autoantibodies against specific human cytochrome P450s have been found in the sera of patients suffering from a variety of diseases, including those caused by drugs. In the cases of tienilic acid- and dihydralazine-induced hepatitis, patients have serum autoantibodies directed against cytochromes P450 2C9 and P450 1A2, respectively. In the present study, we have found that 25 of 56 (45%) patients diagnosed with halothane hepatitis have autoantibodies that react with human cytochrome P450 2E1 that was purified from a baculovirus expression system. The autoantibodies inhibited the activity of cytochrome P450 2E1 and appeared to be directed against mainly conformational epitopes. In addition, because cytochrome P450 2E1 became trifluoroacetylated when it oxidatively metabolized halothane, it is possible that the covalently altered form of cytochrome P450 2E1 may be able to bypass the immunologic tolerance that normally exists against cytochrome P450 2E1. A similar mechanism may explain the formation of autoantibodies that have been found against other cellular targets of the reactive trifluoroacetyl chloride metabolite of halothane.', 'Halothane causes an idiosyncratic hepatitis that is thought to result, in part, from immune reactions against one or more lumenal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins that have been covalently modified by the trifluoroacetyl chloride metabolite of halothane. In this study, we have identified a 170 kDa protein target of halothane in the liver of rats. The 170 kDa protein was first detected when proteins in lysates of hepatocytes from halothane-treated rats were immunoprecipitated with antisera against several resident ER proteins. This 170 kDa protein was found to be associated with other protein targets of halothane, including protein disulfide isomerase, a protein disulfide isomerase isoform, a 59 kDa carboxylesterase, and 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein. Immunoblotting with antiserum directed against the trifluoroacetylated hapten indicated that the 170 kDa protein was trifluoroacetylated. Based upon its subcellular localization, molecular mass, N-terminal amino acid sequence, and antigenicity, the trifluoroacetylated 170 kDa protein was identified as UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT), a lumenal ER protein that is thought to have a role in the folding of N-linked glycoproteins. Moreover, treatment of rats with halothane caused a 44% decrease in the activity of liver microsomal UGGT, and at least 36% of the change in the activity of the enzyme could be due to a decrease in the level of the protein. The results suggest that the function of UGGT in folding of N-linked glycoproteins may be affected by other resident ER proteins or xenobiotics such as halothane.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for Trifluoroacetyl chloride (10 total), please visit the HSDB record page.', 'Trifluoroacetyl chloride is a known human metabolite of Halothane.']",

The 4-hr exposures were carried out in a dynamic chamber at 25 and 75 ppm for MTBE and at 15 and 50 ppm for TAME. The overall mean pulmonary retention of MTBE was 43 +/- 2.6%; the corresponding mean for TAME was 51 +/- 3.9%. Approximately 52% of the absorbed dose of MTBE was exhaled within 44 hr following the exposure; for TAME, the corresponding figure was 30%. MTBE and TAME in blood and exhaled air reached their highest concentrations at the end of exposure, whereas the concentrations of the metabolites tert-butanol (TBA) and tert-amyl alcohol (TAA) concentrations were highest 0.5-1 hr after the exposure and then declined slowly. Two consecutive half-times were observed for the disappearance of MTBE and TAME from blood and exhaled air. The half-times for MTBE in blood were about 1.7 and 3.8 hr and those for TAME 1.2 and 4.9 hr. For TAA, a single half-time of about 6 hr best described the disappearance from blood and exhaled air; for TBA, the disappearance was slow and seemed to follow zero-order kinetics for 24 hr. In urine, maximal concentrations of MTBE and TAME were observed toward the end of exposure or slightly (< or = 1 hr) after the exposure and showed half-times of about 4 hr and 8 hr, respectively. Urinary concentrations of TAA followed first-order kinetics with a half-time of about 8 hr, whereas the disappearance of TBA was slower and showed zero-order kinetics at concentrations above approx. 10 umol/L. Approximately 0.2% of the inhaled dose of MTBE and 0.1% of the dose of TAME was excreted unchanged in urine, whereas the urinary excretion of free TBA and TAA was 1.2% and 0.3% within 48 hr. The blood/air and oil/blood partition coefficients, determined in vitro, were 20 and 14 for MTBE and 20 and 37 for TAME. By intrapolation from the two experimental exposure concentrations, biomonitoring action limits corresponding to an 8-hr time-weighted average (TWA) exposure of 50 ppm was estimated to be 20 umol/L for post-shift urinary MTBE, 1 umol/L for exhaled air MTBE in a post-shift sample, and 30 umol/L for urinary TBA in a next-morning specimen. For TAME and TAA, concentrations corresponding to an 8-hr TWA exposure at 20 ppm were estimated to be 6 umol/L (TAME in post-shift urine), 0.2 umol/L (TAME in post-shift exhaled air), and 3 umol/L (TAA in next morning urine).', 'After inhalation exposure methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) are rapidly taken up by both rats and humans; after termination of exposure, clearance by exhalation and biotransformation to urinary metabolites is rapid in rats. In humans, clearance by exhalation is slower in comparison to rats. Biotransformation of MTBE and ETBE is both qualitatively and quantitatively similar in humans and rats after inhalation exposure under identical conditions. The extent of biotransformation of TAME is also quantitatively similar in rats and humans; the metabolic pathways, however, are different. ...', 'Tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) is absorbed efficiently from the rat intestine. TAME is rapidly absorbed from lungs; the respiration net uptake is 40 %. Studies with tert-methyl butyl ether (MTBE) suggest one third or less of a dermal TAME dose is absorbed. In rats, TAME is distributed evenly in the body. Urine is the main route of elimination.', 'The effect of dose level, duration of exposure and route of administration on the metabolism and distribution of tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) were investigated in male and female F344 rats and CD-1 mice following inhalation or gavage administration. By 48 hr after exposure, >96% of the administered radioactivity was expired in air (16-71%) or eliminated in urine and feces (28-72%). Following inhalation exposure, mice had a two- to threefold greater relative uptake of [14C]TAME compared with rats. Metabolites were excreted in urine of rats and mice that are formed by glucuronide conjugation of tertiary amyl alcohol (TAA), oxidation of TAA to 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methylbutane and glucuronide conjugation of 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methylbutane. A saturation in the uptake and metabolism of TAME with increased exposure concentration was indicated by a decreased relative uptake of total [14C]TAME equivalents and an increase in the percentage expired as volatiles. A saturation of P-450 oxidation of TAA was indicated by a disproportional decrease of 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methylbutane and its glucuronide conjugate with increased exposure concentration.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for Tert-amyl methyl ether (8 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['The biotransformation of tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) in rats and one human volunteer after inhalation of (12)C- or (13)C-labeled TAME /was studied/.

Rats (two males and two females) were individually exposed to 2000 ppm ((12)C or (13)C-TAME for 6 hr, and urine was collected for 48 hr. Free and glucuronidated 2-methyl-2,3-butanediol and a glucuronide of tert-amyl alcohol were identified by (13)C NMR, GC/MS, and LC/MS/MS as major urinary metabolites on the basis of the relative intensities of the (13)C NMR signals. The presence of several minor metabolites was also indicated by (13)C NMR; they were identified as tert-amyl alcohol, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyric acid, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid. One human volunteer was exposed to an initial concentration of 27,000 ppm (13)C-TAME by inhalation for 4 min from a 2 L gas sampling bag, and metabolites of TAME excreted in urine were analyzed by (13)C NMR.

After inhalation, MTBE, ETBE, and TAME were rapidly taken up by both rats and humans; after termination of exposure, clearance from blood of the ethers by exhalation and biotransformation to urinary metabolites occurred with half-times of less than 7 hours in rats and humans. Biotransformation of MTBE and ETBE was similar in humans and rats after inhalation exposure. 2-Hydroxyisobutyrate was recovered as a major product in urine. All metabolites of MTBE and ETBE excreted with urine were eliminated with half-times of less than 20 hours. Biotransformation of TAME was qualitatively similar in rats and humans, but the metabolic pathways were different. In humans, 2-methyl-2,3-butanediol, 2-hydroxy-2-methyl butyrate, and 3-hydroxy-3methyl butyrate were recovered as major urinary products. In rats, however, 2-methyl-2,3-butanediol and its glucuronide were major TAME metabolites recovered in urine. After ingestion of MTBE and TAME, both compounds were rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

Species differences in the area under the curve (AUC) for TAME were significant at each exposure concentration. For rats, the blood TAME AUC increased in proportion with an increase in exposure concentration. For mice, an increase in exposure concentration (100-500 ppm) resulted in a disproportional increase in the TAME AUC. Mice had greater (two- to threefold) blood concentrations of TAA compared with rats following exposure to 2500 or 500 ppm TAME. Mice had a disproportional increase in the TAA AUC with an increase in exposure concentration (100-500 ppm). This difference could result from saturation of a process (e.g. oxidation, glucuronide conjugation) that is involved in the further metabolism of TAA. For each species, gender and exposure concentration, acetone increased during exposure and returned to control values by 16 h following exposure. ...', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for Tert-amyl methyl ether (8 total), please visit the HSDB record page.', 'Tert-amyl methyl ether has known human metabolites that include tert-amyl alcohol.']","['Based on human volunteer studies, the half-lives in blood varied between 1.2 and 6.3 hr.']"

METHODS: In vitro permeation from HPA-H2O binary mixtures through human epidermis and silicone membranes was measured. Thermodynamic activities of HPA and H2O in these mixtures were determined. Permeation was also measured through epidermis and silicone from donor solutions with constant HPA activity but different H2O activities. Water uptake into desiccated human stratum corneum (SC) equilibrated with HPA-H2O mixtures was determined.  RESULTS: Steady-state flux of HPA through silicone was a linear function of HPA activity but not HPA concentration. For epidermis on the other hand, flux increased with HPA activity only for HPA activities = 0.35. At constant HPA activity, flux decreased 4.5-fold as water activity decreased from 1 to 0.8. Incubation of SC with HPA-H2O mixtures resulted in substantial changes in SC water content, dependent on the water activity of the mixture and consistent with measured SC water sorption data.  CONCLUSIONS: These experiments provide unequivocal evidence of a substantial increase in epidermal barrier function resulting from SC dehydration. Dehydration-related alterations in the SC appear responsible for the observed flux characteristics.']",,

Blood samples were drawn from 24 rats per sex in serial groups of 3 at intervals of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 72 hours post dosing and urine was collected from the 72 hours group at 12 hour intervals. The most significant finding from this evaluation was the absence of  any 2-ethylhexyl ester of 2,4-D in either the blood or urine for either sex evaluated (limit of quantification 10 ppb). Conversely 2,4-D acid was detected in both blood and urine. The present data indicate that the 2-ethylhexyl ester of 2,4-D is converted very rapidly to 2,4-D acid, and that the acid is then excreted into the urine. A similarity exists in interval excretion data with that seen in previous investigations with 2,4-D acid.  Indications are that the 2,4-D acid is probably derived via the hydrolysis of the 2-ethylhexyl ester moiety and is eliminated from the body in the same manner as the orally administered 2,4-D acid. It is therefore anticipated from these results that the 2-ethylhexyl ester of 2,4-D should be toxicologically comparable to 2,4-D acid itself.', '2,4-D 2-ethylhexyl ester is hydrolysed to 2,4-D by esterase enzymes present in the gut wall, in blood plasma, in liver cells and in skin.

The study was carried out for 12 healthy volunteers who were divided into two groups. Group I received 58Fe-labeled ferric ammonium citrate (III) (58FeAC) equivalent to 6 mg of iron as a control, and group II received a combination of 500 mg of vitamin C and 58FeAC. A new formula was used to calculate the 58Fe absorption ratio reflecting the pool of iron in the intestinal cells, and the ratio was compared with that obtained from Janghorbani's formula, which has been used as one of the common methods. As a result, the 58Fe absorption ratio in group II was statistically significantly higher than that of group I (34.4 +/- 6.1% vs. 15.0 +/- 5.5%, M +/- SD) using Janghorbani's formula. The similar absorption ratio (34.1 +/- 6.0% vs. 14.8 +/- 5.5%) was also obtained by our new formula. Our results confirmed the previous findings that the availability of iron is stimulated by the supplementation of vitamin C. Both formulae agreed in the absorption of iron, indicating that the endogenous excretion of iron (caused by the desquamated cells) in the intestine does not disguise the iron absorption."", 'The absorption of a commercial brand of small-particle reduced iron was evaluated in 10 normal subjects. For each subject, the hemoglobin incorporation method was used to measure the true absorption of 60 mg of iron from either ferrous sulfate or ferric ammonium citrate. The iron tolerance test (ITT) was also studied for these two compounds and for reduced iron. This procedure consisted of measuring the area under the curve of plasma iron elevations at specified times for 6 hours, or the peak plasma iron, corrected by the plasma iron disappearance rate obtained from measuring plasma iron at specified times for 4 hours after the slow intravenous injection of 0.4 mg of iron as ferric citrate. Only the ITT was used to measure the absorption of 60 mg of reduced iron. Reference dose iron ascorbate absorption was measured in each subject. The absorption of ferric ammonium citrate and reduced iron was expressed as percent of dose and also as absorption percent of that of ferrous sulfate. Mean % geometric ""true absorptions"" were 39.0 for reference dose, 10.4 for FeSO4 and 2.4 for ferric ammonium citrate. The later was 23% that of FeSO4. By ITT the mean geometric % absorptions were 7.9, 3.7 and 3.2 for FeSO4, ferric ammonium citrate and reduced iron respectively, or 47 and 41% of that of FeSO4. We propose that the true absorption of the commercial brand of reduced iron tested was 20% that of FeSO4 based on the relation between the ITT results of reduced iron and the ITT and true absorption values of ferric ammonium citrate in relation to FeSO4.', 'Gastrointestinal absorption of iron is adequate ... /yet/ ... lower from ferrous citrate ... /than ferrous sulfate, fumarate, gluconate, succinate, glutamate, and lactate/.', 'This study demonstrated that anticholinergic agents decreased iron absorption in man and animals. Six normal males were given 10 Ci of 59Fe ferrous citrate dissolved in water containing 250 mg of ferrous sulfate after an overnight fast. Whole body counts were done 4 hours later and used as baseline studies. Sixty minutes before the administration of radioiron, the subjects received a dose of 62.5 mg of hexocyclium methosulfate (Tral). The dose was repeated 6 hours later. Four hours after ingestion of radioiron, whole body counting was done. Every 5 days thereafter, for 15 days, a plateau of body radioactivity was reached in all subjects. Percentage absorption was calculated from the final to initial counts, after correction. Similar experiments were done in rats with atropine sulfate. In both experiments, the anticholinergic agent produced a decrease in iron absorption. The effect of atropine persisted when the iron was delivered intragastrically, but not intraduodenally. Another set of experiments showed that iron absorption decreases when radioiron is intraduodenally given in deproteinized acid gastric juice, or in 0.1N HCl, but not when mixed with neutralized gastric juice.', 'The uptake of ferrous citrate 59Fe was studied in pregnant rats with or without a 4-dimethylamino-stilben(DS)-induced sarcoma tumor. ... The embryo showed higher concentrations of 59Fe. ... Iron loading only affected the embryo liver. Tumors and the placenta showed a different incorporation of 59Fe.']",,

Gallium nitrate inhibits the growth of various lymphoma cell lines in vitro and exhibits antitumor activity in patients with lymphoma. The mechanism(s) of cytotoxicity is (are) only partly understood but appears to involve a two-step process: (1) targeting of gallium to cells, and (2) acting on multiple, specific intracellular processes. Gallium shares certain chemical properties with iron; therefore, it binds avidly to the iron transport protein transferrin. Transferrin-gallium complexes preferentially target cells that express transferrin receptors on their surface. Expression of transferrin receptors is particularly high on lymphoma cells. Cellular uptake of the gallium-transferrin complex leads to inhibition of cellular proliferation primarily via disruption of iron transport and homeostasis and blockade of ribonucleotide reductase. Recent studies have shown that cellular uptake of gallium leads to activation of caspases and induction of apoptosis. In phase II trials in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma, the antitumor activity of gallium nitrate is similar to, or better than, that of other commonly used chemotherapeutic agents.']","['Hormones and molecules with calcium-regulating hormone-like actions that modulate OSTEOLYSIS and other extra-skeletal activities to maintain calcium homeostasis.

Oral absorption of chromium compounds in humans can range between 0.5% and 10%, with the hexavalent (VI) chromium more easily absorbed than the trivalent (III) form. Absorption of chromium from the intestinal tract is low, ranging from less than 0.4% to 2.5% of the amount consumed. Vitamin C and the vitamin B niacin is reported to enhance chromium absorption.  Most hexavalent Cr (VI) undergoes partial intragastric reduction to Cr (III) upon absorption, which is an action mainly mediated by sulfhydryl groups of amino acids. Cr (VI) readily penetrates cell membranes and chromium can be found in both erythrocytes and plasma after gastrointestinal absorption of Cr (IV). In comparison, the presence of chromium is limited to the plasma as Cr (III) displays poor cell membrane penetration. Once transported through the cell membrane, Cr (VI) is rapidly reduced to Cr (III), which subsequently binds to macromolecules or conjugate with proteins. Cr (III) may be bound to transferrin or other plasma proteins, or as complexes, such as glucose tolerance factor (GTF).', 'Absorbed chromium is excreted mainly in the urine, accounting for 80% of total excretion of chromium; small amounts are lost in hair, perspiration and bile.

Brazilian Diet Pills) which combine amphetamines, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, diuretics and laxatives.   In the United States the sale of such diet pills has been banned due to concerns over side effects, and the risk of potentially fatal overdose. However, internet sales and illicit markets has lead to international availability.

Blood samples were drawn from the carotid artery of rats treated with radioactive glyceryl-trinitrate (C-14-GTN), isosorbide-dinitrate (C-14-ISD) or mannitol-hexanitrate (C-14-MHN). The lifetime of the labeled organic nitrates was determined. In another experiment, female rats were intravenously administered one of the radioactive nitrates. Urine was collected hourly, and the samples were counted for radioactive material. A separate experiment was conducted with human liver homogenate, and organic nitrate-reductase activity was measured. In a fourth experiment, rats were treated orally with C-14-GTN and the lymph was collected. Results from the blood clearance investigations showed an extremely rapid initial fall in the blood concentration of the parent compound, with a half life of about 10 to 14 seconds. The disappearance of C-14-MHN was more than 99 percent complete by 90 seconds. Blood was cleared of more than 80 percent of C-14-GTN or C-14-ISD by 1 minute. In the urine samples, the sum of C-14-ISD and C-14-MHN metabolites approached 100 percent of the administered amount. However, the C-14-GTN did not approach 100 percent. The human liver contained the same enzyme capacity for denitration as the rat liver. In the fourth experiment, less than 1 percent of orally administered C-14-GTN was recovered in the lymph after 7 hours.']","['The nature of the formation of nitrite ion from nitrate esters in the presence of blood and tissue suspensions from rabbits was examined. Suspensions were made by homogenizing one part fresh tissue from white-rabbits and four parts aqueous buffer. Equal volumes of the homogenate and a solution of nitrate ester were mixed. Samples for nitrite assay were removed and analyzed. Inorganic nitrite was formed rapidly when glycerol-trinitrate was incubated with the liver homogenate but not with muscle homogenate or diluted whole blood. The rate of nitrite formation from glycerol-trinitrate, l-glucosan-trinitrate, and mannitol-hexanitrate was influenced by pH. Highest volumes formed when the pH was 8.4. Heat had an inactivation effect for glycerol-trinitrate and mannitol-hexanitrate but only partial inactivation took place at low temperatures for l-glucosan-trinitrate while at temperatures between 60 and 100 degrees-C, activity increased. For mannitol-hexanitrate, the amount of nitrite liberated increased with increasing ester concentration. The authors conclude that inorganic nitrite is formed from nitrate esters of polyhydric alcohols by two systems occurring in normal rabbit tissues. The first, occurring principally in the liver, is heat labile while the second, found in liver, muscle, and blood, is activated by heat.']","['Blood samples were drawn from the carotid artery of rats treated with radioactive glyceryl-trinitrate (C-14-GTN), isosorbide-dinitrate (C-14-ISD) or mannitol-hexanitrate (C-14-MHN).  ...

The mechanism of hydrolysis is different for  N -methyl and  N -dimethyl derivatives.  The  N -methyl carbamates pass through an isocyanate intermediate, whereas in the hydrolysis of  N - dimethylcarbamates, an addition product with a hydroxyl ion is formed yielding the alcohol and  N -dimethyl substituted acid.  The rate of hydrolysis by esterases is faster in mammals than in plants and insects. Apart from hydrolysis, oxidation also takes place including: hydroxylation of the aromatic ring,  O -dealkylation,  N -methyl hydroxylation,  N -dealkylation, oxidation of aliphatic side chains, and sulfoxidation to the corresponding sulfone. Oxidation is associated with the mixed-function oxidase (MFO) enzymes. Conjugation leads to the formation of  O - and  N -glucuronides, sulfates, and mercapturic acid derivatives in mammals.  Glycosides and phosphates are conjugation products more common in plants. /Carbamate Pesticides/']",

Total recovery of radioactivity during the 7 day collection period in the urine, feces, and respired (14)C-CO2 was 84-91%, 6-10%, and 0.5% of the administered dose, respectively. Tissue assay showed that 7 days after administration organs contained relatively greater concentrations of compound including the lung (2.7 ppm), liver (2.5 ppm), kidneys (2.3 ppm), and spleen (2.3 ppm).

On the basis of percent dose per whole organ, each of these 11 ... /SRP: tissues contained/ <0.1%, except for liver at 0.3%. Although numerous deficiencies were noted, this study provides supplemental information. Since the compound is rapidly absorbed and excreted, most of the radioactivity in the urine was found during the first 24 hours post-administration.', 'Studies were conducted to characterize the absorption, disposition, metabolism, and excretion of 1,2-dibromo-2,4-dicyanobutane (BCB; methyldibromoglutaronitrile) following iv, oral, and topical administration to male Fischer 344 rats. Following iv administration of (14)C-BCB (8 mg/kg, 120 muCi/kg), no parent compound was detected in the blood; its debrominated metabolite, 2-methyleneglutaronitrile (2-MGN; Cmax 7.3 mug/mL), was observed up to 1 hr. Within 72 hr, greater than 60% of the dose was excreted in the urine and 4.1% in the feces, and 6.6% was exhaled as (14)CO2. ... Following oral administration of (14)C-BCB (80 mg/kg, 100 muCi/kg), approximately 85% of the dose was absorbed, whereas 72% of the dosed radioactivity was recovered in the urine and 9.7% in the feces, 7.5% was exhaled as (14)CO2, 3.5% bound to tissues, and 2.6% bound to blood.', 'The absorption of Methyldibromo Glutaronitrile over a 6 hr post-application period was evaluated. (14)C-Methyldibromo Glutaronitrile (99% pure, specific activity of 15.05 mCi/mmol), in 250 uL of either water or sunscreen formulation, was applied to samples of excised skin from Sprague-Dawley rats and humans such that the concentration loaded was established to be 0.08 mg/sq m of skin surface (radioactivity level of at least 5- 10 uCi/skin preparation). While the specific composition of the sunscreen formulation is not reported, 63% of it was water. Effluents were collected every 15 min for 6 hr. At the end of the assay the skin discs were combusted to determine radioactivity content contained therein. At 6 hr contact time, Methyldibromo Glutaronitrile in the sunscreen formulation was absorbed by human skin to about 0.9%; an additional 2% was detected via combustion of the discs. ...  The test material in the sunscreen vehicle was absorbed to a slightly greater extent by female rat skin, where an average of 1.5% of the applied radioactivity was collected in the effluent after 6 hr, with an additional 3% being found in the discs. Methyldibromo Glutaronitrile in aqueous solution was more readily absorbed by both human and female rat skin, with approximately 33% being absorbed by human skin after 6 hr and 25% absorbed by female rat skin. Combustion of the skin discs detected an additional 13% radioactivity in the human samples and 10% in the rat (male and female). ... Of note is that when the chambers were stoppered to prevent vehicle evaporation, the radioactivity recovered in the effluent from human skin exposed to an aqueous solution dropped from the average of 33% to 16%.', 'Groups of 10 rats (five of each sex; strain and weight not specified) were dosed with (14)C-Methyldibromo Glutaronitrile according to the following procedures, respectively: in single oral doses of 5 and 200 mg/kg, daily oral doses of 5 mg/kg for 15 days, or a single intravenous dose at 5 mg/kg. Excretion via the urine accounted for recovery of >64.6% of radioactivity in all cases. At 168 hr post-exposure, and in all dose groups, the whole blood contained the highest levels of radioactivity. When three male rats were tested following a single oral administration of 5 mg/kg, the peak mean blood level of radioactivity (4.34 ug equiv/g) was measured at 8 hr. This level declined to 2.34 ug equiv/g at 48 hr and 0.75 ug equiv/g at 168 hr. At the time of maximum tissue concentration (8 hr), the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys contained the highest levels of radioactivity. The concentration in other tissues/locations were generally lower than in plasma, with the exception of whole blood. At 48 hr, the highest mean levels of radioactivity were associated with whole blood.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for 1,2-DIBROMO-2,4-DICYANOBUTANE (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['... After iv administration of (14)C-BCB to male Fischer 344 rats, (14)C-equivalents were observed to bind gradually to blood constituents. By 48 hr, approximately 12% of the total dose was covalently bound. At no time was parent compound detected in the blood. However, the debrominated BCB metabolite 2-methyleneglutaronitrile (MGN) was observed. In vitro experiments revealed that BCB was extremely labile and was readily debrominated in fresh whole blood, erythrocyte preparations, and buffered glutathione (GSH) solutions. In each case, the formation of MGN was inhibited by the alkylation of free sulfhydryls with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). For every 1 mole of BCB converted to MGN, 2 moles of GSH were oxidized to glutathione disulfide (GSSG) (BCB + 2 GSH --> MGN + GSSG + 2 HBr). The oxidation of free sulfhydryls during the conversion of BCB to MGN caused erythrocyte hemolysis (EC50 approximately 1 mM) in isolated preparations. Hemolysis was increased by coincubation of BCB with NEM (EC50 approximately 0.3 mM) and was decreased by coincubation with GSH (EC50 > 3 mM). However, MGN did not cause hemolysis of erythrocytes, even at concentrations 10-fold higher than the EC50 of BCB. In vitro experiments also demonstrated that incubation with either BCB or MGN resulted in significant macromolecular binding to the erythrocyte fraction of the blood (approximately 80%). Incubation with NEM resulted in a significant decrease in binding for both BCB (11.3% bound) and MGN (29.5% bound).']",

To overcome this regulation, isofentanyl, another designer fentanyl, was synthesized in a clandestine laboratory and seized by the German police. The aims of the presented study were to identify the phase I and phase II metabolites of 3-methylfentanyl and isofentanyl in rat urine, to identify the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes involved in their initial metabolic steps, and, finally, to test their detectability in urine. Using liquid chromatography (LC)-linear ion trap-mass spectrometry (MS(n)), nine phase I and five phase II metabolites of 3-methylfentanyl and 11 phase I and four phase II metabolites of isofentanyl could be identified. The following metabolic steps could be postulated for both drugs: N-dealkylation followed by hydroxylation of the alkyl and aryl moiety, hydroxylation of the propanamide side chain followed by oxidation to the corresponding carboxylic acid, and, finally, hydroxylation of the benzyl moiety followed by methylation. In addition, N-oxidation of isofentanyl could also be observed. All hydroxy metabolites were partly excreted as glucuronides. Using recombinant human isoenzymes, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 were found to be involved in the initial metabolic steps. Our LC-MS(n) screening approach allowed the detection of 0.01 mg/L of 3-methylfentanyl and isofentanyl in spiked urine. However, in urine of rats after the administration of suspected recreational doses, the parent drugs could not be detected, but their common nor metabolite, which should therefore be the target for urine screening.']",

Urine, feces and expired air were collected at 24 hr intervals for groups A and B, while urine and feces were collected from groups C and D. Absorption of test chemical at the low and high dose was between 80-90% for all dose groups, as suggested by excretion data showing the majority of a dose eliminated through urine or exhaled air. Excretion of IPBC-derived radioactivity was mainly via the urine, with between 50-70% of an administered dose excreted by this route at 168 hours post-dose. Feces was a minor route of excretion in all dose groups (4-7% of the administered dose), while radiolabelled CO2 constituted between 18-24% of the administered dose.

In parallel studies, oral administration of 58 mg (0.3 mCi/mmol)/kg body weight of [3H]4-nitropyrene to female Sprague-Dawley rats, which are susceptible to mammary carcinogenesis by this agent, yielded 32% and 30.6% of the dose after 48 hr as urinary and fecal excretion products, respectively. Excretion of the radioactivity remained slightly higher in the urine than in feces throughout 168 hr after administration. Some of the fecal metabolites (isolated amounts expressed as % of dose) were identified as 4-aminopyrene (5.4), 9(10)-hydroxy-4-(acetylamino)pyrene (3.3), and unmetabolized 4-nitropyrene (2.4). Sulfates (3.3) and glucuronides (2.4) of 9(10)-hydroxy-4-(acetylamino)pyrene were identified in the urine. This study indicates that nitroreduction and ring oxidation are metabolic pathways of 4-nitropyrene in vivo; similar findings were obtained previously with its structural isomers 1- and 2-nitropyrene. However, the pattern of excretion of 4-nitropyrene is different ...', '... The ability of 15 human hepatic and 8 pulmonary microsomal samples to metabolize / 1-, 2-, and 4-nitropyrene were compared/.  Human hepatic microsomes were competent in metabolizing all three isomers. Qualitatively similar metabolic patterns were observed, although at much lower levels, upon incubating mono-NP with pulmonary microsomes. Ring-oxidized metabolites (phenols and trans-dihydrodiols) were produced from all three isomers. However, the nitroreductive metabolism leading to the formation of aminopyrene was evident only with 4-NP. The role of specific P450 enzymes in the human hepatic microsomal metabolism of mono-NP was investigated by correlating the P450-dependent catalytic activities in each microsomal sample with the levels of individual metabolites formed by the same microsomes and by examining the effects of agents that can either inhibit or stimulate specific P450 enzymes in mono-NP metabolism ... Most of the hepatic microsomal metabolism of 1- and 4-NP /was attributed/ to P450 3A4, although a minor role for P450 1A2 cannot be ruled out. Specifically, P450 3A4 was responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxy-1nitropyrene from 1-NP and the formation of trans-9,10-dihydro-9,10dihydroxy-4-nitropyrene, 9(10)-hydroxy-4-nitropyrene, and 4-aminopyrene from 4-NP. None of the P450 enzymes examined (P450s 3A4, 1A2, 2E1, 2A6, 2D6, and 2C9) appeared to be involved in catalyzing the formation of trans-4,5-dihydro-4,5-dihydroxy-2-nitropyrene and 6-hydroxy-2-nitropyrene from 2-NP in human hepatic microsomes ...', '4-nitropyrene has known human metabolites that include (4R,5R)-9-nitro-4,5-dihydropyrene-4,5-diol and 4-aminopyrene.']",

These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. It exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation.

No human carfentanil metabolism data are available. Reportedly, Russian police forces used carfentanil and remifentanil to resolve a hostage situation in Moscow in 2002. This alleged use prompted interest in the pharmacology and toxicology of carfentanil in humans. Our study was conducted to identify human carfentanil metabolites and to assess carfentanil's metabolic clearance, which could contribute to its acute toxicity in humans. We used Simulations Plus's ADMET Predictor and Molecular Discovery's MetaSite to predict possible metabolite formation. Both programs gave similar results that were generally good but did not capture all metabolites seen in vitro. We incubated carfentanil with human hepatocytes for up to 1 hr and analyzed samples on a Sciex 3200 QTRAP mass spectrometer to measure parent compound depletion and extrapolated that to represent intrinsic clearance. Pooled primary human hepatocytes were then incubated with carfentanil up to 6 h and analyzed for metabolite identification on a Sciex 5600+ TripleTOF (QTOF) high-resolution mass spectrometer. MS and MS/MS analyses elucidated the structures of the most abundant metabolites. Twelve metabolites were identified in total. N-Dealkylation and monohydroxylation of the piperidine ring were the dominant metabolic pathways. Two N-oxide metabolites and one glucuronide metabolite were observed. Surprisingly, ester hydrolysis was not a major metabolic pathway for carfentanil. While the human liver microsomal system demonstrated rapid clearance by CYP enzymes, the hepatocyte incubations showed much slower clearance, possibly providing some insight into the long duration of carfentanil's effects.""]",

MeIQx and PhIP were measured in urine after acid treatment that quantitatively hydrolyzes the Phase II conjugates to the respective parent amine. The extracts containing the HAAs were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and analyzed by liquid chromatography using electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. The MeIQx content in the 0-12 hr urine increased after acid hydrolysis by a factor of 3-21-fold. After acid treatment, the total amount of MeIQx (unmetabolized plus the N2-glucuronide and sulfamate metabolites) excreted in the 0-12 hr urine was 10.5 +/- 3.5% (mean +/- SD) of the dose, whereas the total amount of PhIP (unmetabolized plus acid-labile conjugate(s)) in the 0-12 hr period was 4.3 +/- 1.7% (mean +/- SD) of the dose. The total amount of PhIP in the 12-24 hr urine after acid treatment was 0.9 +/- 0.4% (mean +/- SD) of the dose. Linear regression analysis of the amounts of MeIQx and PhIP excreted in the 0-12 hr period expressed as a percentage of the ingested dose, for all subjects, gave a low but significant correlation (r = 0.37, P = 0.005).

These results indicate that in humans, MeIQx metabolism and disposition are more strongly influenced by CYP1A2 activity than are those of PhIP. Linear regression analysis found no association between NAT2 activity and the levels (unmetabolized plus acid-labile conjugates) of MeIQx or PhIP excreted in urine.', 'The kinetics of distribution of radiolabelled [2-14]C-IQ (2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline) and [2-14]C-MeIQx (2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline) following the oral administration to BALB/c mice of single doses were studied. Both compounds were taken up into the blood-stream and other tissues rapidly after administration, and approx 20-25% of the radioactive dose of IQ or MeIQx was excreted in urine over 6 hr, reflecting the rapid absorption of the mutagens. Significantly greater levels of MeIQx than IQ were isolated from the lungs and blood of treated mice. In studies of the uptake of IQ from closed sections of the gut, little IQ was absorbed from the stomach.

By means of experiments with (32)P-labeled DNA fragments and an electrochemical detector coupled to a high-pressure liquid chromatograph, we investigated whether the N-hydroxy metabolite of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) can cause oxidative DNA damage or not. This metabolite [MeIQx(NHOH)] was found to cause Cu(II)-mediated DNA damage, including 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine formation. When an endogenous reductant, beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), was added, the DNA damage was greatly enhanced. Catalase and bathocuproine, a Cu(I)-specific chelator, inhibited the DNA damage, suggesting the involvement of H2O2 and Cu(I). MeIQx(NHOH) frequently induced DNA cleavage at thymine and cytosine residues in the presence of NADH and Cu(II). A UV-visible spectroscopic study showed that little decomposition of MeIQx(NHOH) occurred in the absence of Cu(II), whilst rapid spectral change was observed in the presence of Cu(II), suggesting that Cu(II) catalyzes the autoxidation. The addition of NADH reduced the oxidized product back to MeIQx(NHOH). These results suggest that a copper-peroxo intermediate, derived from the reaction of Cu(I) with H2O2, participates in Cu(II)-dependent DNA damage by MeIQx(NHOH), and NADH enhances the DNA damage via a redox cycle. /It was concluded/ that in addition to DNA adduct formation, oxidative DNA damage plays an important role in the carcinogenic process of MeIQx.  /MeIQx (NHOH)/"", ""2-Amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), one of the most abundant of the heterocyclic aromatic amines formed during the cooking of meat, is genotoxic and carcinogenic in rodents.

While there is indirect evidence that the mutagenic product is N-hydroxy-MeIQx (N-OHMeIQx), ... this /was identified/ unequivocally following incubation of the amine with human hepatic microsomal fraction. A mixture of unlabelled MeIQx, (13C,15N2)MeIQx and (14C)MeIQx was used as substrate and the products analysed by HPLC-thermospray mass spectrometry. Characteristic doublet ions, 3 mass units apart, were found at m/z 214/217 ([M+H]+) from the parent compound, MeIQx and at 230/233 ([M+H]+) from N-OHMeIQx. The presence of a doublet ion at m/z 214/217 with the doublet at 230/233 [M+H+] provided additional evidence that this was N-OHMeIQx, as facile loss of 'O' is characteristic of N-hydroxylamines. Further evidence for the identity of the major metabolite, which accounted for approximately 90% of all microsomal metabolism, was obtained by comparing the mutagenicity of the HPLC eluate using Salmonella typhimurium YG1024, which is particularly sensitive to N-hydroxylamines, and TA98/1,8-DNP6 which is resistant to most N-hydroxylamines. Ninety-five per cent of direct-acting mutagenicity present in the reaction mixture was associated with a single peak, which co-eluted with N-OHMeIQx, as indicated by mass spectrometry. In the presence of a metabolic activation system, only one additional mutagenic peak, corresponding to unchanged MeIQx, could be detected. MeIQx (5 microM) was N-hydroxylated at a rate of 77 +/- 11 pmol/mg/min (mean +/- SEM, n = 4) by human liver microsomes. The specific inhibitor of human CYP1A2, furafylline (5 uM) inhibited the N-hydroxylation of MeIQx by > 90%.

After intraperitoneal dosing to rats (7.5 mg/kg), FB1 was rapidly absorbed and reached a maximum concentration in plasma within 20 min after injection. Thereafter, it underwent rapid removal from plasma, displaying a mono-exponential elimination phase that fitted a one-compartment model with a half-life of 18 min. Collection of 24- and 48-hr urine samples indicated that only 16% of the applied dose was eliminated unmetabolized in urine, all within the first 24-hr period following dosing. In contrast to this, a similar dose of FB1 given by gavage resulted in the recovery of only 0.4% of the FB1 in urine.', 'Fumonisin B1 (FB1), a toxic and   carcinogenic secondary metabolite of the fungus Fusarium moniliforme Sheldon, was administered   either by i.v. injection or by gavage to vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops). FB1 dosed  by  i.v. injection to two female vervet monkeys was rapidly eliminated from plasma with a mean   half-life during the elimination phase of 40 min. Analysis of urine and faeces over a 5 day   period after dosing gave an average 47% recovery of the dose as FB1 and its hydrolysed   analogues. Two female vervet monkeys were given a single gavage dose of 14C-labelled FB1.   During the subsequent 3 day period, faecal excretion of radioactivity accounted for an average   of 61% of the administered dose and urinary excretion 1.2%. Residual radioactivity was   recovered in low levels from skeletal muscle (1%), liver (0.4%), brain (0.2%), kidney, heart,   plasma, red blood cells and bile (each 0.1%), while the contents of the intestines accounted   for a further 12% of the radioactive dose. In total, 76% of the administered radioactivity was   recovered. Analysis of the faeces, intestinal contents and urine indicated that over 90% of   the radioactivity in these samples was due to FB1 and its hydrolysis products.', 'A method has been developed for the determination of fumonisin B1 (FB1) in the feces of     non-human primates (vervet monkeys). The animals were dosed with 14C-labelled FB1, and the     radioactive compounds in faeces were recovered by repeated extractions with 0.1 M     ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The extracts were cleaned-up on a reversed-phase (C18)     solid-phase extraction cartridge, and FB1 was determined by o-phthaldialdehyde derivatization     and reversed-phase HPLC. The analytical method for the determination of FB1 in the fecal     extracts was reproducible [2.6% relative standard deviation (RSD)] and accurate (recovery from  spiked blank extracts of 93 +/- 2.9% RSD). Confirmation of the identification of FB1 in faeces  was achieved using HPLC and thin-layer chromatography, which showed that the radioactivity  extracted corresponded mainly to FB1 and a new metabolite with chromatographic properties  similar to those of the mycotoxin. The new metabolite was identified by mass spectrometry and  nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to be an equilibrium mixture of the two structural  isomers of partially hydrolysed FB1, which are formed by hydrolysis of one of the ester groups  of the mycotoxin.', 'The mycotoxin fumonisin B1 (FB1) causes a variety of health problems in animals, while epidemiological evidence suggests it is linked to human esophageal cancer. We investigated the carry-over of FB1 into bovine milk using the isolated perfused bovine udder.

About 2% of the dose remained in the carcass after 7 days. It is stated that the major route of musk xylene excretion was the feces via the bile. However, no quantitative data were available. Concentrations in adipose tissue and liver were 3.8 and 2.9 times the blood level, respectively. The levels in kidneys and lungs were somewhat higher than the blood level. The other tissues and organs had similar or lower levels than the blood level.', 'Bioaccumulation in blood and tissues was measured by GC-ECD in adult and developing Long Evans rats.

Pups were killed at postnatal days 1 or 14. Offspring exhibited dose dependent musk xylene accumulation with 1/2 - 3/4 of adult female or 3-4 times adult male body fat levels at 100 mg/kg feed. Musk xylene levels in milk were comparable to adult female adipose tissue levels. In rats fed musk xylene in adulthood, levels were highest in adipose tissue with significant amounts in other organs (ovary, adrenal). In females tissue levels were 3.7-6.8 times higher than in males. This sex difference is not explained, but according to the authors it was unrelated to body fat content and unlikely to be related to differences in rate of elimination.

Possible temporal trends in musk concentrations and associations with lifestyle/medical factors, such as use of perfumed products during pregnancy were studied. HHCB showed the highest median concentration (63.9 ng/g lipid) followed by AHTN (10.4 ng/g) and musk xylene (MX) (9.5 ng/g). Concentrations of the other substances were, in most cases, below the quantification limit (2.0-3.0 ng/g)."", ""The absorption, distribution and excretion of radioactivity have been measured after topical application of 0.5 mg ring-(14)C-musk xylene/kg bw to the shaven backs of 16 CD Sprague- Dawley and 5 Long-Evans rats ... After a 6 hour application the dressing was removed and the area of treated skin was wiped with cotton wool containing 1% ethanolic phenylethyl alcohol ... About 8% of the applied dose was absorbed from the shaven backs during 6 hours. About 14% of the dose remained in the skin after the washing which continued to be absorbed. A total of about 20% of the dose was absorbed during 48 hours with 2% remaining in the skin ... In CD rats' means of 3.9% and 15.2% of the applied dose had been excreted in the urine and feces, respectively, after 120 hours with only about 0.2% remaining in the carcass. In Long-Evans rats the rate of elimination was very similar with 4.0% and 14.0% of the dose excreted during 5 days in the urine and feces, respectively. Most of the radioactivity was eliminated in the first 48 hours after start of dosing. Between 48 and 120 hours /less than/ 0.5% and /less than/ 3% of the dose was excreted in the urine and feces, respectively. Radioactivity was not detected in expired air. Radioactivity was detected in nearly all the tissues of animals killed after 24 hours. Concentrations were highest at about 8 hours after start of dosing and then declined steadily. Highest concentrations after 8 hours were present in the gastro-intestinal tract (0.868 ug equivalents/g), adipose tissue (0.159 ug/g), liver (0.062 ug/g), and pancreas (0.0425 ug/g), kidneys (0.0265 ug/g) of CD rats. Levels of radioactivity in these tissues remained the highest throughout the study. Concentrations of radioactivity in the adrenals (0.0685 ug/kg after 8 hours) and the thyroid (0.0696 ug/kg) were also among the highest up to 24 hours but then declined rapidly ... In the albino CD rats the concentration of radioactivity in the eyes reached a peak of 0.0044 ug/kg after 24 hours declining to below the level of determination after 48 hours, while in the pigmented Long-Evans rats the concentration of radioactivity in the eyes rose gradually throughout the 5 day period from 0.0041 ug/kg at 6 hr to 0.0064 ug/kg after 120 hours. In the bile duct cannulated rats radioactivity was excreted in the bile at a steady rate of ca. 1.4% of the dose per hour in both CD and Long-Evans rats.

Oxidation of organophosphorus insecticides may result in more or less toxic products. The glutathione transferase reactions produce products, that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Hydrolytic and transferase reactions affect both thioates and their oxons. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/', 'It is well-known that active metabolites of most organophosphorus insecticides react covalently to some extent with tissue esterases other than AChE. Since few of these esterases appear vital to health, the binding reaction may be considered a detoxification process. Although the catalytic activity of these esterases is high, the actual quantity of such sites is comparatively small. Crude measurements using 32 P-labelled diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (an agent reacting with most organophosphorus-sensitive esterases) suggest that 100-150 g bind/kg bw of an adult hen injected with about the LD50 dose. Binding was principally in liver and muscle. The quantity bound would not be expected to be much greater whatever the LD50 of an administered organophosphorus insecticide. Thus, it is a significant proportion of the total dose only for a very toxic compound such as paraoxon but not for compounds with much higher LD50s. However, the number of binding sites may, in some cases, be very significant compared with the quantity of circulating anticholinesterase oxon that has avoided other metabolic disposal processes. Molecules of oxon bound to these non-vital sites are prevented from attacking the vital sites such as AChE or NTE. Binding sites can therefore be considered an important second line of defence against intoxication. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/']",

On gestation Days 12 (organogenesis) and 18 (postorganogenesis), peak concentrations of radiocarbon occurred 4-8 hr after dose administration in the placenta, embryo/fetus, amniotic fluid, and maternal kidney, brain, and lung, and declined slightly at 24 hr postdose. Maternal lung contained the highest tissue concentration of radiocarbon at all time points. Placenta and maternal brain, kidney, and liver contained moderate levels of radioactivity, while embryonic/fetal tissue, amniotic fluid, and maternal plasma contained low levels of radioactivity. Mean fetal concentrations of radiocarbon at 4, 8, and 24 hr on gestation Day 18 were higher than mean embryonic concentrations on Day 12 of gestation.

Results indicated that embryonic/fetal and maternal tissue levels of fluoxetine were greatest at early time points and declined with time, while norfluoxetine tissue levels were highest at the 24 hr time point. Whole-body autoradiographic techniques demonstrated that radioactivity associated with (14)C fluoxetine and/or its metabolites traversed the placenta and distributed throughout the 18 day fetus 4 hr following dose administration.

The correlation studies between the fluoxetine N-demethylase activity and various CYP enzyme activities were performed. Selective inhibitors or chemical probes of various cytochrome P-450 isoforms were also employed. The kinetics of norfluoxetine formation in all liver microsomes were fitted by a single-enzyme Michaelis-Menten equation (mean Km=32 umol/L +/- 7 umol/L). Significant correlations were found between N-demethylation of fluoxetine at both 25 umol/L and 100 umol/L and 3-hydroxylation of tolbutamide at 250 micromol/L (r1=0.821, P1=0.001; r2=0.668, P2=0.013), respectively, and S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylase activity (r=0.717, P=0.006) at high substrate concentration of 100 umol/L. S-mephenytoin (SMP) (a CYP2C19 substrate) at high concentration and sulfaphenazole (SUL) (a selective inhibitor of CYP2C9) substantially inhibited norfluoxetine formation. The reaction was minimally inhibited by coincubation with chemical probe, inhibitor of CYP3A4 (triacetyloleandomycin, TAO). The inhibition of fluoxetine N-demethylation at high substrate concentration (100 umol/L) was greater in PM livers than in EM livers (73 % vs 45 %, P < 0.01) when the microsomes were precoincubated with SUL plus TAO. Cytochrome p450 CYP2C9 is likely to be a major CYP isoform catalyzing fluoxetine N-demethylation in human liver microsomes at a substrate concentration close to the therapeutic level, while polymorphic CYP2C19 may play a more important role in this metabolic pathway at high substrate concentration."", ""The exact metabolic fate of fluoxetine has not been fully elucidated. The drug appears to be metabolized extensively, probably in the liver, to norfluoxetine and several other metabolites.

The potency and selectivity of norfluoxetine's serotonin-reuptake inhibiting activity appear to be similar to those of the parent drug. Both fluoxetine and norfluoxetine undergo conjugation with glucuronic acid in the liver, and limited evidence from animals suggests that both the parent drug and its principal metabolite also undergo O-dealkylation to form p-trifluoromethylphenol, which subsequently appears to be metabolized to hippuric acid.""]","['The half-life of fluoxetine reportedly is prolonged (to approximately 4-5 days) after administration of multiple versus single doses, suggesting a nonlinear pattern of drug accumulation during long-term administration.', 'Following a single oral dose of fluoxetine in healthy adults, the elimination half-life of fluoxetine reportedly averages approximately 2-3 days (range: 1-9 days) and that of norfluoxetine averages about 7-9 days (range: 3-15 days).', 'The mean half-life /for fluoxetine/ was 6.6 vs 2.2 days ... for patients with cirrhosis vs normal volunteers.']"

Mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones including trovafloxacin is different from that of penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, macrolides, and tetracyclines. Therefore fluoroquinolones may be active against pathogens that are resistant to these antibiotics. There is no cross-resistance between trovafloxacin and the mentioned classes of antibiotics.

However, highly lipophilic ICS accumulate in systemic tissues, which may lead to adverse systemic effects. The accumulation of a new, highly lipophilic ICS, ciclesonide and its active metabolite (des-CIC) has not yet been reported. Here, we have compared tissue accumulation of des-CIC and an ICS of a moderate lipophilicity, budesonide (BUD), after 14 days of once-daily treatment in mice. Single, three or 14 daily doses of [(3) H]-des-CIC or [(3) H]-BUD were administered subcutaneously to male CD1 albino mice, which were killed at 4 hrs, 24 hrs or 5 days after the last dose. Distribution of tissue concentration of radioactivity was studied by quantitative whole-body autoradiography. Pattern of radioactivity distribution across most tissues was similar for both corticosteroids after a single as well as after repeated dosing. However, tissue concentration of radioactivity differed between des-CIC and BUD. After a single dose, concentrations of radioactivity for both corticosteroids were low for most tissues but increased over 14 days of daily dosing. The tissue radioactivity of des-CIC at 24 hrs and 5 days after the 14th dose was 2-3 times higher than that of BUD in majority of tissues. Tissue accumulation, assessed as concentration of tissue radioactivity 5 days after the 14th versus 3rd dose, showed an average ratio of 5.2 for des-CIC and 2.7 for BUD (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, des-CIC accumulated significantly more than BUD. Systemic accumulation may lead to increased risk of adverse systemic side effects during long-term therapy.']","['Budesonide is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4; the 2 main metabolites have less than 1% of affinity for glucocorticoid receptors than the parent compound. Budesonide is excreted in urine and feces as metabolites.', 'Asthma is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world, for which the mainstay treatment has been inhaled glucocorticoids (GCs). Despite the widespread use of these drugs, approximately 30% of asthma sufferers exhibit some degree of steroid insensitivity or are refractory to inhaled GCs. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is interpatient variability in the clearance of these compounds. The objective of this research is to determine how metabolism of GCs by the CYP3A family of enzymes could affect their effectiveness in asthmatic patients. In this work, the metabolism of four frequently prescribed inhaled GCs, triamcinolone acetonide, flunisolide, budesonide, and fluticasone propionate, by the CYP3A family of enzymes was studied to identify differences in their rates of clearance and to identify their metabolites. Both interenzyme and interdrug variability in rates of metabolism and metabolic fate were observed. CYP3A4 was the most efficient metabolic catalyst for all the compounds, and CYP3A7 had the slowest rates. CYP3A5, which is particularly relevant to GC metabolism in the lungs, was also shown to efficiently metabolize triamcinolone acetonide, budesonide, and fluticasone propionate. In contrast, flunisolide was only metabolized via CYP3A4, with no significant turnover by CYP3A5 or CYP3A7. Common metabolites included 6 Beta-hydroxylation and Delta (6)-dehydrogenation for triamcinolone acetonide, budesonide, and flunisolide. The structure of Delta (6)-flunisolide was unambiguously established by NMR analysis. Metabolism also occurred on the D-ring substituents, including the 21-carboxy metabolites for triamcinolone acetonide and flunisolide. The novel metabolite 21-nortriamcinolone acetonide was also identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and NMR analysis.']",

The drug in tissues was extracted with ethyl acetate, and borneol's concentration detected by GC, with octadecane as the internal standard. The calibration curve showed a good linear relationship. Extraction recoveries, inter-day and intra-day precisions and stability were in conformity with the analytical requirements of biological samples. Borneol was mainly distributed in most tissues, more in heart, brain and kidney, and less in liver, spleen and lung. The established GC-FID method is applicable for content determination of borneol in tissues. After intravenous and intranasal administrations in mice, borneol is mainly distributed in abundant blood-supply tissues. After intranasal administration, brain tissues showed the highest target coefficient and target effectiveness."", '... In order to understand the blood and brain pharmacokinetics after intravenous, intranasal, or oral administration and to investigate the superiority and feasibility of intranasal administration, a simple gas chromatographic (GC) method with flame ionization detection (FID) was developed for the quantification of borneol. Blood samples and brain were collected from mice at 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after intravenous, intranasal, or oral administration of borneol at a dosage of 30.0 mg/kg. Sample preparations were carried out by liquid-liquid extraction with an internal standard solution of octadecane. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated /using computer software/. The calibration curves were linear in the range of 0.11-84.24 ug/mL and 0.16-63.18 ug/g for borneol in plasma and brain, respectively. The methodological and extraction recoveries were both in the range of 85%-115%. The intra-day and inter-day variabilities for plasma and brain samples were </= 5.00% relative standard deviation (RSD). The absolute bioavailabilities F of intranasal and oral administrations were 90.68% and 42.99%. The relative brain targeted coefficients Re of intranasal and oral administrations were 68.37% and 38.40%. The GC-FID method developed could be applied to determination and pharmacokinetic study. The borneol from injection was distributed and metabolized fast without absorption process. The borneol from oral administration was distributed more slowly and had the lowest absolute bioavailability. Nasal administration of borneol was quickly absorbed into the blood and brain, was easy to use and had a greater safety than infection, which makes it worthy of further development as an administration route for encephalopathy treatment.', 'The aim of this work was to study the in situ and in vivo nasal absorption of borneol. A novel single pass in situ nasal perfusion technique was applied to examine the rate and extent of nasal absorption of borneol by rats. Experimental conditions, such as perfusion rate, pH and drug concentration, were investigated. The in situ experiments showed that the nasal absorption of borneol was not dependent on drug concentration, and fitted a first order process. The absorption rate constant, Ka, influenced with an increase in perfusion speed. The borneol was well absorbed in the conditions of the nasal cavity within the pH range and pH value of physiological conditions. In vivo studies of borneol absorption were carried out in rats and the pharmacokinetics parameters of intranasal (in) was compared with intravenous (iv) administration. The bioavailabilities of borneol was 90.82% for i.n. while Tmax values were 10 min. MRT (Mean Residence Time) were 262.55 +/- 67.35 min and 204.22 +/- 14.50 min for in and iv methods, respectively. The results demonstrate that borneol could be absorbed promptly and thoroughly by in administration in rats.', ""Previous studies have indicated that borneol has double side effects on the central nervous system (CNS), but the mechanism is unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between excitation ratio [contents of excitatory amino acids (AAs) versus that of inhibitory] and the content of natural borneol after a single oral dose. Mice were administered a 1.2 g/kg dose of natural borneol (containing 98% D: -borneol) by oral ingestion. Brain samples were collected before administration and at 0.083, 0.167, 0.25, 0.333, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5 hr after administration. The brain concentration of natural borneol and contents of AA neurotransmitters in mice brain were determined by GC-MS and HPLC-FLU, respectively. After per oral application, natural borneol was absorbed rapidly into the brain and could be determined 5 min after dosing. The maximal brain concentration (86.52 ug/g) was reached after 1 hr post-dosing. Natural borneol could affect the contents of AA neurotransmitters in mice brain: L: -aspartic acid increased significantly from 0.083 to 1 hr after administration, L: -glutamic acid increased significantly at 0.333 hr and decreased from 1.5 to 5 hr, gamma-amino-N-butyric acid increased significantly from 0.167 to 5 hr, whereas glycine was not affected. The excitation ratio is the contents of excitatory AAs versus that of inhibitory AAs, which reflects the excitatory or inhibitory state of the body. The excitation ratio elevated transitorily and then declined 0.5 hr post-dosing; there were significant differences between 1.5-5 hr post-dose compared with pre-dose. The present study indicated that natural borneol could affect the contents of AA neurotransmitters, and the change in excitatory ratio led to borneol's double side effects on the CNS."", 'The percutaneous absorptions of camphene, isoborneol-acetate, limonene, menthol and alpha-pinene as constituents of a foam bath (Pinimenthol) were measured on animals using radioactively labeled ingredients. Pharmacokinetic measurements showed maximum blood levels for all tested ingredients 10 min after the onset of percutaneous absorption. None of the ingredients was preferentially absorbed. Blood levels of all ingredients after 10 min of percutaneous absorption were a direct function of the size of the skin area involved.']",,

Endothelin (ET), a vasoconstrictor, and nitric oxide (NO), a vasodilator, which are synthesized in the kidney by the vascular endothelium as well as by tubular epithelial and glomerular mesangial cells, are key modulators of renal circulation after CM administration. Intravascular CM, in addition, induces pronounced diuresis and natriuresis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare changes in endogenous vasoactive mediators and contrast-induced natriuresis after CM administration.  Diagnostic angiographic procedures were performed in 14 patients (9 males and 5 females) using the non-ionic CM Iopamidol. Before and immediately after angiography, venous blood and urine samples were obtained. The urinary excretion of ET-1 and nitrates/nitrites (NOx), and the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) were measured and analyzed. The urinary excretion of both ET-1 and NOx increased significantly (p < 0.05) after angiography, and urinary ET-1 and NOx excretion was correlated with an increase in FENa (p < 0.05). Exposure to CM in humans is associated with an increase in urinary ET and NOx. The excretion of sodium following CM administration is associated with an increase in urinary ET and NOx. ET and NO might be important in the renal change in humans after CM administration.', 'No iodinated compound other than Iopamidol was found in the urine of subjects who received intrathecal injection of 10 mL of Iopamiro ""300"".

Half-life beta was equal to 1.67 h in healthy volunteers, 4.24 h in patients with mild renal failure and 10.03 h in patients with severe renal failure.

Radioactivity accumulated on both sides of the ligature 24 hours and, to a larger extent, 48 hours after the injection. In contrast, there was no accumulation in animals pretreated with naloxone, neither in ligated sciatic nerves nor between two ligatures in the vagus nerve. An accumulation of stereospecific (3)H-lofentanil binding sites measured in vitro was only detected above the ligature, thus in the proximal part of the nerve. When (3)H-lofentanil was injected at different time intervals after ligation, we observed a tremendous drop of labelling in the distal and also but more slowly in the proximal part of the nerve. This could be due to a possible recycling or re-utilization of (3)H-lofentanil binding sites. The present data are compatible with an axoplasmic flow and a possible recycling of opiate receptors labelled in vivo after intravenous injection of (3)H-lofentanil.', 'The in vivo binding of (3)H-lofentanil was studied in various regions of the brain in rat. After intravenous injection of (3)H-lofentanil the disposition of the labelled drug in the brain paralleled exactly the regional distribution of opiate receptors measured in in vitro binding assays. The labelling was saturable and could be prevented by naloxone when given before (3)H-lofentanil, in all the regions except in the cerebellum. The long-lasting occurrence of the specific labelling was entirely compatible with the extremely slow dissociation rate of lofentanil and its long duration of action. This explains why (3)H-lofentanil is not displaceable by naloxone in vivo. Subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that all the labelling in the frontal cortex but not in the cerebellum was particulate-bound and entirely displaceable by naloxone. The advantages of (3)H-lofentanil in vivo are its extremely low non-specific binding and its ability to reveal very low occupancy of opiate receptors in brain.', 'The in vitro plasma protein binding and distribution in blood of fentanyl and three analogues were studied in rats, dogs and healthy volunteers. In human plasma, 84.4% of fentanyl was bound, 92.5% of sufentanil, 92.1% of alfentanil and 93.6% of lofentanil. Plasma protein binding of the four analgesics was independent of their concentration over the whole therapeutic range. Plasma protein binding of alfentanil was much less pH dependent than that of the three other analgesics. Attention was drawn to the possible contribution of the ""acute phase"" protein alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP), of lipoproteins and of blood cells to the binding of fentanyl and its analogues in blood.', 'The influence of the pH of the incubation medium on the cellular accumulation of tritiated fentanyl, lofentanil, and alfentanil was investigated in isolated guinea pig atria. Fentanyl and lofentanil accumulated in atrial tissue up to about 30- and 50-fold, respectively. The amount of drug bound when equilibrium was attained was found to be dependent upon the pH of the medium. By plotting binding equilibria v. pH of the bath, curves were obtained which resembled titration curves. Half-maximal binding was attained at pH values close to the pKa values of fentanyl and lofentanil. Alfentanil was found to accumulate less. The uptake by the tissue was strongly proportional to the extracellular concentration. Atria equilibrated with fentanyl at pH 8.5 released the compound rapidly when exposed to a pH of 7.0, even in the continuous presence of fentanyl in the bath. The consequences of the findings for in vivo conditions are discussed with respect to a possible augmentation of the actions of fentanyl by respiratory acidosis.']",,

Mass spectrometry data along with high-performance liquid chromatography retention data (fluorescence detection) of the synthetic reference standards were consistent with those of the metabolites found in human bile after administration of bendamustine hydrochloride to cancer patients. Analysis of the purified synthetic reference compounds showed a purity of at least 95%. Structural confirmation was achieved by one- and two-dimensional proton as well as carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.

Glutathione S-conjugates of bendamustine have not been detected in bile samples, indicating rapid enzymatic cleavage in humans. Both the lack of glutathione (GSH) conjugates and occurrence of diastereomeric sulfoxides emphasize species-related differences in the GSH conjugation of bendamustine between humans and rats.

All formulations were generally well tolerated. Oral DHA was rapidly absorbed from gastrointestinal tract with marked inter-individual variation. The pharmacokinetics of DHA following the two dose levels were similar and linearity in its kinetics was observed. Based on the model-independent pharmacokinetic analysis, median (95% CI) values for Cmax of 181 (120-306) and 360 (181-658) ng/ml were achieved at 1.5 hours following 2 and 4 mg/kg body weight dose, respectively.

Oral AS was rapidly biotransformed to DHA, which was detectable in plasma as early as 15 minutes of AS dosing. Following 4 mg/kg dose, median (95% CI) value for Cmax of 519 (236-284) ng/mL was achieved at 0.7 (0.25-1.5) hours.

However, a very low plasma level was obtained even after a dose of 300 mg/kg.  Liver was found to be the chief site of inactivation.  When artemisinin was given i.m., significant and more persistent plasma levels were detected.  Artemisinin was shown to pass the blood-brain and blood-placenta barriers after i.v. injection.

This metabolic activation, requiring both microsomal and cytosolic fractions, was observed with not only rat liver, but also human, monkey, and mouse liver S9 fractions. To characterize the active metabolites of BPA and BPB, /the researchers/ investigated the structures of the isolated active metabolites by negative mode LC/MS/MS and GC/MS. The active metabolite of BPA gave a negative mass peak at [M-H](-) 267 on LC/MS and a single daughter ion at m/z 133 on MS/MS analysis, suggesting an isopropenylphenol dimer structure. Finally, this active metabolite was confirmed to be identical with authentic 4-methyl-2,4-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)pent-1-ene (MBP) by means of various instrumental analyses. The corresponding peaks of the BPB metabolite were [M-H](-) 295 and m/z 147, respectively, suggesting an isobutenylphenol dimer structure. Further, coincubation of BPA and BPB with rat liver S9 afforded an additional active metabolite(s), which gave a negative mass peak at [M-H](-) 281 and two daughter ion peaks at m/z 133 and m/z 147 on MS/MS analysis. These results strongly suggest that the active metabolite of either BPA or BPB might be formed by recombination of a radical fragment, a one-electron oxidation product of carbon-phenyl bond cleavage. It is noteworthy that the estrogenic activity of MBP, the active metabolite of BPA, is much more potent than that of the parent BPA in several assays, including two reporter assays using a recombinant yeast expressing human estrogen receptor alpha and an MCF-7-transfected firefly luciferase plasmid.']",

The drug was rapidly N-deethylated to dexnorfenfluramine achieving comparatively low mean maximum plasma levels (Cmax) of 12-14 ng/ml in all primates, and rapidly disappeared thereafter with half-lives (t1/2) ranging from 2 to 3 h in the baboon and rhesus monkey to 6 h in the cynomolgus monkey.

The metabolite-to-parent drug ratio (14-37), in terms of plasma area under curve (AUC), greatly exceeded that in man (< 1), being higher than in all species investigated so far. 3. Comparative repeat dose simulation in monkey and man indicated that the dosage in primates would need to be increased 10-fold to achieve comparable dexfenfluramine steady-state plasma Cmax, producing nor-metabolite levels several times those in man, whilst for comparable metabolite Cmax, those of the parent drug would be correspondingly too low. 4.

It was recently shown that the apparent non-renal clearance of dexfenfluramine was significantly lower in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolisers of debrisoquine which suggested the involvement of the polymorphically expressed enzyme, CYP2D6, in dexfenfluramine metabolism. In this study, human liver microsomes and yeast-expressed recombinant enzymes were used to examine dexfenfluramine metabolism in vitro. In human liver microsomes, the major product of dexfenfluramine was nordexfenfluramine with lesser amounts of a novel metabolite, N-hydroxynordexfenfluramine, and ketone and alcohol derivatives being formed. Eadie-Hofstee plots (v against v/[s]) of nordexfenfluramine formation between 1 and 1000 microM substrate concentration were biphasic in three of four liver microsome samples examined, with mean Km values of 3 and 569 microM for the high and low affinity enzymes, respectively. At a substrate concentration (0.5 microM) around the known therapeutic plasma concentration, there was negligible inhibition of microsomal dexfenfluramine N-dealkylation by sulphaphenazole and ketoconazole, but between 33 and 100% inhibition by quinidine, and 0-58% inhibition by 7,8-naphthoflavone in seven liver samples. In human liver microsomes, there was also a significant correlation (rs= 0.79, n = 10, P < 0.01) between dextromethorphan O-demethylation and dexfenfluramine (at 1 microM) N-dealkylation activities. Dexfenfluramine was a specific inhibitor (IC50 46 microM) of CYP2D6-mediated dextromethorphan O-demethylation in human liver microsomes but did not appreciably inhibit six other cytochrome P450 isoform-selective activities for CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2E1 and 3A activities in human liver microsomes. Yeast-expressed recombinant human CYP2D6 metabolized dexfenfluramine with high affinity (Km 1.6 microM, Vmax 0.18 nmol min(-1) nmol P450(-1)) to nordexfenfluramine which was the sole product observed. Recombinant CYP1A2 was a lower affinity enzyme (Km 301 microM, Vmax 1.12 nmol min(-1) nmol P450(-1)) and produced nordexfenfluramine with small amounts of N-hydroxynordexfenfluramine. This is the first detailed study to examine the in-vitro metabolism of dexfenfluramine in human liver microsomes and by recombinant human P450s. We were able to identify CYP2D6 (high affinity) and CYP1A2 (low affinity) as the major enzymes catalysing the N-dealkylation of dexfenfluramine in human liver microsomes.', 'Dexfenfluramine has known human metabolites that include nordexfenfluramine.']","['17-20 hours', 'It has an elimination half life of approximately 32 hours.']"

As for (3)H-phencyclidine binding, (3)H-dexoxadrol binding sites are highly concentrated in brain regions such as the cortex and the hippocampus. However, other areas such as the hypothalamus are enriched only in (3)H-dexoxadrol binding sites.

Two employees ... accidentally inhaled insoluble particles of iridium-192 ... and were kept under periodic examination for 2 years ... . The inhalation incident occurred ...  when a hot cell technician, seeking to open a capsule containing 2,000 Ci of iridium-192 pellets, accidentally cut into eight of the pellets. ...  As a result of the loss of negative pressure within the cell, about 2 Ci escaped...  The iridium was apparently inhaled as submicron-sized particles of metal, with perhaps some oxide ...  They went to lunch ... without knowing about their exposure. They returned to the plant about 2 hours after the exposure and then checked their hands on a beta-gamma monitor. ... The employees were decontaminated at the plant and were sent to the University of Pittsburgh whole-body counter about 8 hr after the initial exposure... .  Measurements with portable scintillation-counter and GM-counter survey meters, at about arm's length, immediately indicated that one of the employees had an internal total body burden on the order of 1 to 2 mCi, and that his coworker had about one-third of this burden. ... Calculations of possible GI tract and lung doses ... indicated that serious exposures might be incurred. All fecal and urinary excreta of the two higher-exposed individuals ... were collected and the individuals were hospitalized for several days for further medical diagnosis and body burden evaluation. No chelation therapy was administered since none of the known therapeutic agents was expected to be effective against iridium metal... . External measurements with portable survey instruments already indicated at 10 hr postexposure that a considerable fraction of the inhaled material had entered the stomach and low portions of the gastrointestinal tract. ... The decrease of lung burden in these cases followed closely the 74.2-d half-life of iridium-192 for many weeks. The lung scans over several weeks showed a pattern typical of a uniform distribution of these submicron iridium particles throughout the lung alveoli for the several weeks over which the scans were taken. This information together with material balances from fecal and in vivo measurements, showed that the lung retention of the two patients after 24 hr was 6 and 13%, respectively, of the initially inhaled amount, the remainder exhaled or cleared through the fecal route with no urinary excretion ... .  Long-term measurements, as indicated above, showed no biological removal of iridium from the lung after initial mucociliary clearance and no measurable 192-Ir in the urine, despite the large initial depositions in both cases. (Measurements of urine ... showed that there was less than 1X10-4 uCi excreted in urine per day, which was less than one-millionth of the remaining lung burden per day.  Statistical interpretation of the long-term data indicated that the biological half-life of metallic iridium in the lung, even as submicron particles, was at least as great as about 700 d, and possibly infinite.""]",,

The later products were postulated to be formed by oxidative properties of mucochloric acid (MCA). The formation of the chloroprenal derivatives, ethanocarbaldehyde derivatives and etheno derivatives from MCA is explained by an initial formation of mucoxychloric acid, which may be further broken down to chloroacetaldehyde, which could proceed via the chloromalonaldehyde that reacts with the nucleosides and forms subsequently the derivatives.""]",

Female Wistar-rats were given a single intraperitoneal (ip) dose of diethenylbenzene (DEB) at 300mg/kg. Diethenylbenzene was extensively oxidized to an electrophilic oxirane which was attacked by glutathione forming conjugates which were further metabolized through the mercapturic-acid pathway to form mercapturic acids. Another important pathway involved the epoxide-hydrolase catalyzed hydration of the oxirane forming a glycol which was further oxidatively metabolized to ethenyl mandelic, glyoxylic and benzoic acids. A minor metabolic pathway involved the rearrangement of the oxirane to an ethenyl phenylacetaldehyde. Rats given a single ip dose of 1,4-diethenylbenzene excreted nearly 5.6 percent of the dose as the glycine conjugate, regardless of the dose given. The total thioether fraction decreased significantly with increasing initial doses accounting for 23, 17, and 12 percent of the doses at 100, 200, and 300mg/kg, respectively.', '...

This pathway was postulated to convert the carcinogen into an aminating species. To submit this postulate to further test, we examined liver proteins of rats treated with 2-nitropropane, other carcinogenic secondary nitroalkanes, or the related rat liver tumorigen acetoxime for the presence of 3-aminotyrosine, the expected product of tyrosine amination. Using ion-pair and/or cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, we found that the liver cytosolic proteins of these animals contained 0.1-1.5 mol of 3-aminotyrosine/10(3) mol of tyrosine. Treatment with the noncarcinogenic primary nitroalkane 1-nitropropane or with other primary nitroalkanes did not produce an analogous increase in the aminated amino acid (level of detection estimated at approximately 0.01 mol/10(3) mol of tyrosine). ... In vitro studies with acetoxime-O-sulfonate and hydroxylamine-O-sulfonate showed that these proposed intermediates in the activation pathway of 2-nitropropane react with guanosine to give 8-aminoguanosine, N1-aminoguanosine, and 8-oxoguanosine and also react with tyrosine to give 3-aminotyrosine and 3-hydroxytyrosine. The in vitro amination and oxidation of guanosine at C8 were also produced by acetophenoxime-O-sulfonate and 2-heptanoxime-O-sulfonate. These results provide additional evidence for the production of a reactive species capable of aminating nucleic acids and proteins from 2-nitropropane and other carcinogenic secondary nitroalkanes by a pathway involving oxime- and hydroxylamine-O-sulfonates as intermediates.', 'Acetoxime and methylethyl ketoxime (MEKO) are tumorigenic in rodents, inducing liver tumors in male animals. The mechanisms of tumorigenicity for these compounds are not well defined. Oxidation of the oximes to nitronates of secondary-nitroalkanes, which are mutagenic and tumorigenic in rodents, has been postulated to play a role in the bioactivation of ketoximes. In these experiments, we have compared the oxidation of acetoxime and methylethyl ketoxime to corresponding nitronates in liver microsomes from different species. The oximes were incubated with liver microsomes from mice, rats, and several human liver samples. After tautomeric equilibration and extraction with n-hexane, 2-nitropropane and 2-nitrobutane were quantitated by GC/MS-NCI (limit of detection of 250 fmol/injection volume). In liver microsomes, nitronate formation from MEKO and acetoxime was dependent on time, enzymatically active proteins, and the presence of NADPH. Nitronate formation was increased in liver microsomes of rats pretreated with inducers of cytochrome P450 and reduced in the presence of inhibitors (n-octylamine and diethyldithiocarbamate). Rates of oxidation of MEKO (Vmax) were 1.1 nmol/min/mg (mice), 0.5 nmol/min/mg (humans), and 0.1 nmol/min/mg (rats). In addition to nitronates, several minor metabolites were also enzymatically formed (two diastereoisomers of 3-nitro-2-butanol, 2-hydroxy-3-butanone oxime and 2-nitro-1-butanol). Acetoxime was also metabolized to the corresponding nitronate at rates approximately 50% of those observed with MEKO oxidation in the three species examined. 2-Nitro-1-propanol was identified as a minor product formed from acetoxime. No sex differences in the capacity to oxidize acetoxime and MEKO were observed in the species examined. The observed results show that formation of sec-nitronates from ketoximes occurs slowly, but is not the only pathway involved in the oxidative biotransformation of these compounds. Due to the lack of sex-specific oxidative metabolism, other metabolic pathways or mechanisms of tumorigenicity not involving bioactivation may be involved in the sex-specific tumorigenicity of ketoximes in rodents.', 'The hepatocarcinogenicity of acetoxime has been tentatively linked with its metabolic oxidation to the potent genotoxicant and carcinogen propane 2-nitronate (P2-N). In order to test the hypothesis that acetoxime is metabolized to P2-N, the oxime (20 mM) was incubated with liver microsomes from mice, rats and two humans. Ion-pair HPLC analysis of the incubates afforded a peak that co-eluted with P2-N. P2-N exists in tautomeric equilibrium with 2-nitropropane (2-NP). Samples of the microsomal incubates, which had been adjusted to pH 5.5 and kept for 24 hr in order to allow maximal tautomeric equilibration of P2-N to 2-NP to occur, were extracted with hexane. GLC analysis of the extracts yielded a peak that co-eluted with 2-NP, and gave a mass spectrum identical to that of authentic 2-NP. The metabolite peak obtained on HPLC was isolated and its hexane extract contained also 2-NP when investigated by GLC. P2-N was found by HPLC in the urine of rats that had received acetoxime (3.36 mmol/kg i.p.). Hexane extracts of urine samples, which had been adjusted to pH 5.5 and left for 24 hr, contained 2-NP as demonstrated by GLC analysis. The results are consistent with the suggestion that the toxicity of acetoxime is associated with its biotransformation to P2-N.']",

The reduction of malachite green (MG) to leucomalachite green (LMG) by intestinal bacteria from humans, rats, mice and rhesus monkeys and 14 pure cultures of anaerobic bacteria representative of those found in the human gastrointestinal tract. The bacterial cultures were incubated with 300 ug of MG in 5 mL of brain-heart infusion broth for 24-48 hr under anaerobic conditions. Virtually all of the MG was converted to its LMG derivative by the intestinal microflora. The pure bacterial cultures converted 7.3-99.3% of the MG to LMG. These results indicate the importance of the gastrointestinal tract microflora in the conversion of MG to LMG.', 'Intestinal microfloras from human, rat, mouse, and monkey fecal samples and 14 pure cultures of anaerobic bacteria representative of those found in the human gastrointestinal tract metabolized the triphenylmethane dye malachite green to leucomalachite green. The reduction of malachite green to the leuco derivative suggests that intestinal microflora could play an important role in the metabolic activation of the triphenylmethane dye to a potential carcinogen.', 'Malachite green (MG) is still illegally used as a fungicide in aquaculture. In fish it is absorbed and metabolised to its major reduced metabolite, leucomalachite green (LMG).

After two days a decrease of the half life from 34.0 +/- 0.7 to 17.1 +/- 4.3 h was found within the circulation at the highest dose.

Whereas in the cells of the liver PFC droplets may be broken up, freed from their surfactant layer and handled according to their individual components, for PFC in the blood stream an unchanged composition should be assumed. Both results, the decreasing half life and the change in composition of the circulating emulsion may best be explained by a shrinking and instability of the emulgator film, showing the necessity for development of a superior surfactant. /Fluosol-DA/', 'The effect of an emulsion of perfluorochemicals (PFC) (7 parts perfluorodecalin and 3 parts perfluorotripropylamine, 4.4 g PFC/kg body weight) on organ function was determined.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the concentrations of PFOS, PFHxS, and PFOA in pooled human milk samples obtained in Sweden between 1972 and 2008 (a period representing the most significant period of PFA production) and to see whether the time trend of these analytes parallels that indicated in human serum. Chemical analysis of PFOS, PFHxS, and PFOA was performed on pooled Swedish human milk samples from 1972 to 2008 after methodological refinements. The 20 samples which formed the 2007 pool were also analyzed individually to evaluate sample variations. Analyses were performed by HPLC-MS/MS. Due to the complexities of the human milk matrix and the requirement to accurately quantitate low pg/mL concentrations, meticulous attention must be paid to background contamination if accurate results are to be obtained. PFOS was the predominant analyte present in the pools and all three analytes showed statistically significant increasing trends from 1972 to 2000, with concentrations reaching a plateau in the 1990s. PFOA and PFOS showed statistically significant decreasing trends during 2001-2008. At the end of the study, in 2008, the measured concentrations of PFOS, PFHxS, and PFOA in pooled human milk were 75 pg/mL, 14 pg/mL, and 74 pg/mL, respectively. The temporal concentration trends of PFOS, PFHxS, and PFOA observed in human milk are parallel to those reported in the general population serum concentrations.', ""/MILK/ The presence of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in breast milk has been documented, but their lactational transfer has been rarely studied. Determination of the elimination rates of these chemicals during breastfeeding is important and critical for assessing exposure in mothers and infants. We aimed to investigate the association between breastfeeding and maternal serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS). For a subset of the population, for whom we also have their infants' measurements, we investigated associations of breastfeeding with infant serum PFAA concentrations. The present analysis included 633 women from the C8 Science Panel Study who had a child < 3.5 years of age and who provided blood samples and reported detailed information on breastfeeding at the time of survey. PFAA serum concentrations were available for all mothers and 8% (n = 49) of the infants. Maternal and infant serum concentrations were regressed on duration of breastfeeding. Each month of breastfeeding was associated with lower maternal serum concentrations of PFOA (-3%; 95% CI: -5, -2%), PFOS (-3%; 95% CI: -3, -2%), PFNA (-2%; 95% CI: -2, -1%), and PFHxS (-1%; 95% CI: -2, 0%). The infant PFOA and PFOS serum concentrations were 6% (95% CI: 1, 10%) and 4% (95% CI: 1, 7%) higher per month of breastfeeding. Breast milk is the optimal food for infants, but is also a PFAA excretion route for lactating mothers and exposure route for nursing infants."", ""Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) are normally the dominant perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in human serum, but here a Canadian family of seven was identified with particularly high exposure to perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS). Disproportionately high serum PFHxS concentrations (range 27.5-423 ng/mL) and moderately high PFOS (range 15.2-108 ng/mL) and PFOA (range 2.40-9.23 ng/mL) concentrations were detected in the family members, with all three chemicals being highest in the youngest children. We therefore sought to identify the source(s) and pathway(s) of this unusual exposure, and to study the excretion of PFASs for this family. Serum, urine, and stool were sampled from family members, carpet, dust, and air were sampled in the home, and a questionnaire was administered. Over 15 years, the family's household carpets were treated 8 times with Scotchgard formulations. Elevated concentrations of PFHxS were detected in household dust (2780 ng/g dust) and in family room carpet (2880 ng/g carpet), and the primary mode of excretion for the major PFASs was through urine. The high PFHxS and moderately high PFOS concentrations in serum and household samples are consistent with the known PFAS content of certain Scotchgard formulations, and exposure was likely through dust ingestion and/or inhalation."", 'A total of 100 serum samples from 50 new couples (none of the females in this study has ever been pregnant) in Tianjin, North China, were analyzed for eleven perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) with isomer-specific method. Among all samples, total perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS, mean 11.3 ng/mL) was predominant followed by total perfluorooctanoate (PFOA, 2.95 ng/mL), perfluorodecanoate (PFDA, 1.17 ng/mL), perfluorononanoate (PFNA, 0.93 ng/mL) and perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS, 0.67 ng/mL). The mean concentrations of PFOS and PFHxS in males (14.2 and 0.89 ng/mL) were significantly higher (p=0.001) than in females (8.36 and 0.45 ng/mL). No statistical difference between genders was observed for the other PFAAs. This suggests that menstruation is one important elimination pathway for PFOS and PFHxS in females. Linear PFOA was the dominant isomer with mean proportion of 99.7%, suggesting that telomeric PFOA (and its precursors), which contains almost pure linear isomer, might be the dominant exposure source of PFOA in Tianjin. On average, the proportion of linear PFOS (n-PFOS) was 59.2% of PFOS, which was lower than that in technical PFOS products (ca. 70% linear). Except perfluoroisopropyl PFOS, all the other monomethyl branched PFOS isomers were enriched in human serum compared to the commercial products, suggesting the monomethyl branched PFOS precursors were preferentially biotransformed in humans /SRP: or a differential clearance occurred/.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for Perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']",,"['Perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) has been found in biological samples from wildlife and humans. The human geometric mean serum PFHxS elimination half-life has been estimated to be 2665 days. A series of studies was undertaken to establish pharmacokinetic parameters for PFHxS in rats, mice, and monkeys after single administration with pharmacokinetic parameters determined by WinNonlin software. Rats and mice appeared to be more effective at eliminating PFHxS than monkeys. With the exception of female rats, which had serum PFHxS elimination half-life of approximately 2 days, the serum elimination half-lives in the rodent species and monkeys approximated 1 month and 4 months, respectively, when followed over extended time periods (10-24 weeks). Collectively, these studies provide valuable insight for human health risk assessment regarding the potential for accumulation of PFHxS in humans.']"

Adult trout were exposed to perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) via food over a time period of 28 d. In the following 28-d depuration period the fish were fed PFAA-free food. At defined sampling times four animals were removed from the experimental tank, euthanized and dissected. Muscle, liver, kidneys, gills, blood, skin and carcass were examined individually. At the end of the accumulation phase between 0.63% (PFOA) and 15.5% (PFOS) of the absolute, applied quantity of PFAAs was recovered in the whole fish. The main target organ was the liver with recovery rates between 0.11% (PFBS) and 4.01% (PFOS) of the total amount of ingested PFAAs. Perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids were taken up more readily and had longer estimated elimination half-lives than perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids of the same chain length. The longest estimated elimination half-lives were found to be for PFOS between 8.4 d in muscle tissue and 20.4 d in the liver and for PFNA between 8.2 d in the blood and 11.6 d in the liver.', 'PFBS was not detected in maternal sera (n = 20), cord sera (n = 20) or human milk (n = 17) taken from the general population of Seoul, South Korea (LOD of 0.1, 0.05 and 0.0011 ng/mL, respectively)', 'Materials derived from perfluorobutanesulfonyl fluoride (PBSF, C(4)F(9)SO(2)F) have been introduced as replacements for eight-carbon homolog products that were manufactured from perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride (POSF, C(8)F(17)SO(2)F). Perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS, C(4)F(9)SO(3)(-)) is a surfactant and potential degradation product of PBSF-derived materials. The purpose of this series of studies was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of PFBS in rats, monkeys, and humans, thereby providing critical information for human health risk assessment. Studies included: (1) intravenous (i.v.) elimination studies in rats and monkeys; (2) oral uptake and elimination studies in rats; and (3) human serum PFBS elimination in a group of workers with occupational exposure to potassium PFBS (K(+)PFBS). PFBS concentrations were determined in serum (all species), liver (rats), urine (all species), and feces (rats). In rats, the mean terminal serum PFBS elimination half-lives, after i.v. administration of 30 mg/kg PFBS, were: males 4.51 +/- 2.22 hr (standard error) and females 3.96 +/- 0.21 hr. In monkeys, the mean terminal serum PFBS elimination half-lives, after i.v. administration of 10 mg/kg PFBS, were: males 95.2 +/- 27.1 hr and females 83.2 +/- 41.9 hr. Although terminal serum half-lives in male and female rats were similar, without statistical significance, clearance (CL) was significantly greater in female rats (469 +/- 40 mL/hr) than male rats (119 +/- 34 mL/hr) with the area under the curve (AUC) significantly larger in male rats (294 +/- 77 ug.hr/mL) than female rats (65 +/-5 ug.hr/mL). These differences were not observed in male and female monkeys. Volume of distribution estimates suggested distribution was primarily extracellular in both rats and monkeys, regardless of sex, and urine appeared to be a major route of elimination. Among 6 human subjects (5 male, 1 female) followed up to 180 days, the geometric mean serum elimination half-life for PFBS was 25.8 days (95% confidence interval 16.6-40.2). Urine was observed to be a pathway of elimination in the human. Although species-specific differences exist, these findings demonstrate that PFBS is eliminated at a greater rate from human serum than the higher chain homologs of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS). Thus, compared to PFOS and PFHxS, PFBS has a much lower potential for accumulation in human serum after repeated occupational, non-occupational (e.g., consumer), or environmental exposures.', 'The toxicokinetics of perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and nonafluoro-1-butanesulfonic acid (PFBS) were evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Systemic exposure to PFHxA was lower than for PFBS following single equivalent intravenous or oral (rat only) doses. Serum clearance was more rapid for PFHxA than for PFBS. In rats, exposure to PFHxA and PFBS was up to 8-fold (intravenous) and 4-fold (oral) higher for males than females and serum clearance of PFHxA and PFBS was more rapid in females than males; however, there was no appreciable difference in the extent or rate of urinary elimination between compounds or genders. There were no apparent differences between genders in the serum half-life for PFHxA following 26 days of repeated oral dosing in rats; exposure decreased upon repeated dosing.', 'Perfluorobutanesulfonyl fluoride (PBSF) has been introduced as a replacement for its eight-carbon homolog perfluorooctanesulfonyl fluoride (POSF) in the manufacturing of fluorochemicals. Fluorochemicals derived from PBSF may give rise to perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) as a terminal degradation product. Although basic mammalian toxicokinetic data exist for PFBS, information on its tissue distribution has only been reported in one study focused on rat liver. Therefore, here we characterized the tissue distribution of PFBS in mice in the same manner as we earlier examined its eight-carbon homolog perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) to allow direct comparisons. Following dietary exposure of adult male C57/BL6 mice for 1, 3 or 5d to 16 mg (35)S-PFBS/kg/d, both scintillation counting and whole-body autoradiography (WBA) revealed the presence of PFBS in all of the 20 different tissues examined, demonstrating its ability to leave the bloodstream and enter tissues. After 5d of treatment the highest levels were detected in liver, gastrointestinal tract, blood, kidney, cartilage, whole bone, lungs and thyroid gland. WBA revealed relatively high levels of PFBS in male genital organs as well, with the exception of the testis. The tissue levels increased from 1 to 3 d of exposure but appeared thereafter to level-off in most cases. The estimated major body compartments were whole bone, liver, blood, skin and muscle. This exposure to PFBS resulted in 5-40-fold lower tissue levels than did similar exposure to PFOS, as well as in a different pattern of tissue distribution, including lower levels in liver and lungs relative to blood.']",,"['In rats, the mean terminal serum PFBS elimination half-lives, after i.v. administration of 30 mg/kg PFBS, were: males 4.51 +/- 2.22 hr (standard error) and females 3.96 +/- 0.21 hr.

Half lives (t(1/2)) in male and female rats were calculated to be 0.10 and 0.05 days, respectively, for PFHA, 5.63 and 0.08 days for PFOA, 29.5 and 2.44 days for PFNA and 39.9 and 58.6 days for PFDA. Total clearance (CL(tot)) of PFHA was higher than those of other perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) in both male and female rats. By contrast, CL(tot) of PFDA was extremely low in both sexes. PFCAs having shorter carbon chain length showed higher CL(tot). There was a significant sex-related difference in CL(tot) of PFOA and PFNA. Distribution volumes in steady state (V(ss)) were not much different between PFCAs and between sexes. To estimate the role of urinary excretion in plasma clearance of PFCA, renal clearance (CL(R)) was determined for PFCAs. CL(R) of PFCAs were in the order PFHA>PFOA>PFNA approximately equal PFDA and PFHA approximately equal PFOA>PDNA>PFDA in male and female rats, respectively. There was a close relationship between CL(tot) and CL(R) (r(2)=0.981). Plasma protein binding, estimated in vitro, was over 98% for all PFCAs tested. The results indicate that CL(R) is responsible for the difference in CL(tot) between PFCAs having different carbon chain length and between sexes.', 'Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we investigated the importance of carbon chain length with regard to the hepatic effects associated with perfluoro-n-carboxylic acids. Male F-344 rats were administered a single intraperitoneal dose of either perfluoro-n-heptanoic acid (C7-PFA), perfluoro-n-nonanoic acid (C9-PFA), or perfluoro-n-undecanoic acid (C11-PFA). Data from previous studies involving perfluoro-n-octanoic acid (C8-PFA) and perfluoro-n-decanoic acid (C10-PFA) are included for comparison. Food consumption/body weight was monitored daily for all groups. C9- and C11-PFA treatment yields a prolonged hypophagic response while C7-PFA shows a more acute response. Fluorine-19 NMR spectra of urine and bile samples show no evidence of fluorometabolites and suggest that the distribution of perfluorocarbons into urine or bile is dependent upon carbon chain length. The aqueous solubility of C7-PFA appears to facilitate rapid urinary excretion, similar to that observed for C8-PFA. The relative hydrophobicity of C9- and C11-PFA appears to favor biliary enterohepatic recirculation, yielding a more protracted toxicity, similar to C10-PFA. Phosphorus-31 NMR studies of liver in vivo and liver extracts show that perfluorocarbons of >/= C9 carbons produce a significant increase in liver phosphocholine concentration. These data are discussed with regard to the impact of these chemicals on hepatic phospholipid metabolism. Hepatic peroxisomal fatty acyl CoA-oxidase activity (FAO) was measured to determine if C7-, C9-, and C11-PFA are peroxisome proliferators. Data indicate that the induction of peroxisomal enzyme activity by perfluorocarbons requires a chain length greater than seven carbons. In general, these results demonstrate the significance of carbon chain length in the hepatotoxic response and provide clues toward understanding the processes involved in the biological activities associated with exposure to these compounds.', 'Elimination in urine and feces was compared between four perfluorinated fatty acids (PFCAs) with different carbon chain length. In male rats, perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHA) was rapidly eliminated in urine with the proportion of 92% of the dose being eliminated within 120 hr after an intraperitoneal injection. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) was eliminated in urine with the proportions of 55, 2.0 and 0.2% of the dose, respectively. By contrast, four PFCAs were eliminated in feces with the proportion of less than 5% of the dose within 120 hr after an injection. In female rats, the proportions of PFOA and PFNA eliminated in urine within 120 hr were 80% and 51% of the dose, respectively, which were significantly higher compared with those in male rats. There was the tendency that PFCA with longer carbon chain length is less eliminated in urine in both male and female rats. Fecal elimination of PFCAs was not different between PFCAs in female rats and comparable to those in male rats. The rates of biliary excretion of PFCAs in male rats were slower than those in female rats. Sex-related difference in urinary elimination of PFOA was abolished when male rats had been castrated. On the contrary, treatment with testosterone suppressed the elimination of PFOA in urine in both castrated male rats and female rats. The effect of testosterone was in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that PFCAs are distinguished by their carbon chain length by a renal excretion system, which is regulated by testosterone.']",,"['Rat (Wistar), adult, male. Route: IV.

Skin absorption is insignificant, except in patients with skin breakdown (e.g., burns, ulcers, severe ichthyosis). Increased metabolic rate can lead to greater inhalational absorption as well. Peak blood levels occur soon after inhalation but occur in 1 to 2 hours after oral administration. The chemicals distribute to tissues with high blood flow (e.g., brain, heart, liver, kidney) and then to adipose tissue, where the highest chemical concentrations are typically found. Halogenated hydrocarbons are metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P-450 oxidation. Partial glutathione conjugation may occur. Halogenated solvents can be excreted unchanged through the lungs. Elimination half-lives can be increased because of either prolonged exposure or hepatic dysfunction. Prolonged exposure allows more chemical to be stored in the adipose tissue, which serves as a source of continued release. /Halogenated Hydrocarbons - Halogenated Solvents/', '... The safety and pharmacokinetics of HFC 134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) and HFC 227 (1,1,1,2,3,3, 3-heptafluoropropane)  were assessed in two separate double-blind studies. Each HFC (hydrofluorocarbon) was administered via whole-body exposure as a vapor to eight (four male and four female) healthy volunteers. Volunteers were exposed, once weekly for 1 hr, first to air and then to ascending concentrations of HFC (1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 ppm), interspersed with a second air exposure and two CFC 12 (dichlorodifluoromethane) exposures (1000 and 4000 ppm). HFC 134a, HFC 227, and CFC 12 blood concentrations increased rapidly and in an exposure-concentration-dependent manner, although not strictly proportionally, and approached steady state. Maximum blood concentrations (C(max)) tended to be higher in males than females; in the HFC 227 study, these were statistically significantly (P < 0. 05) higher in males for each HFC 227 and CFC 12 exposure level. ... In the HFC 227 study, t(1/2)alpha (alpha elimination half-life) for both CFC 12 and HFC 227, at each exposure level, was short (< 9 min) and tended to be lower in males than females. For CFC 12 mean t(1/2)beta (beta elimination half-life) ranged from 23 to 43 min and for HFC 227 the mean range was 19-92 min. The values tended to be lower for females than males for HFC 227. For both CFC 12 and HFC 227, mean residence time (MRT) was statistically significantly lower (P < 0.05) in males than females and independent of exposure concentration. For CFC 12, MRT was a mean of 37 and 45 min for males and females, respectively, and for HFC 227 MRT was a mean of 36 and 42 min, respectively...']","['The biotransformation of the aerosol propellant 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFA-227) was investigated in rats in vivo and in rat and human liver microsomes. In the urine of rats exposed to 5000 ppm HFA-227 for 6 hr, very small amounts of hexafluoroacetone trihydrate were identified as an HFA-227 metabolite by 19F-NMR. Fluoride concentrations in the urine samples (0-48 hr after the end of the exposure) from exposed animals were not significantly different from those found in samples from nonexposed rats. In rat and human liver microsomes, fluoride and hexafluoroacetone trihydrate formation from HFA-227 was detected in very low levels only in liver microsomes from pyridine-treated rats and in two of eight human liver microsome samples, which exhibited the highest cytochrome P4502E1 activities. Because some aldehydes may covalently bind to proteins and the formation of fluorinated protein adducts has been implicated in immune-mediated hepatitis induced by halothane, the binding of hexafluoroacetone trihydrate to proteins was also investigated. Hexafluoroacetone trihydrate also gave only a very small resonance in fluorine NMR experiments when binding to human serum albumin was studied in comparison with the acylating agent S-ethyltrifluoroacetate. Moreover, no fluorine-containing products were formed by the reaction of hexafluoroacetone trihydrate with N alpha-acetyl-L-lysine, and hexafluoroacetone trihydrate was not metabolized to fluorine-containing metabolites or inorganic fluoride in rats. Comparative studies in human liver microsomes demonstrated that a halothane metabolite may covalently bind to proteins; in contrast, metabolism and covalent binding of HFA-227 could not be demonstrated. In summary, these data indicate that HFA-227 is biotransformed at very low rates to hexafluoroacetone trihydrate but irreversible binding of hexafluoroacetone trihydrate cannot be demonstrated, even with the application of very sensitive methods, and is considered unlikely, based on the combination of the results obtained.']",['HFA 227 showed a biphasic elimination from the body after exposure (mean T1/2: approx. 6.5 minutes and 44.5 minutes).']

Five metabolites were detected in the incubation solution of the extracts and LMMNPs, which were identified by means of HPLC-MS as trans-imperatorin hydroxylate (M1), cis-imperatorin hydroxylate (M2), imperatorin epoxide (M3), trans-isoimperatorin hydroxylate (M1') and cis-isoimperatorin hydroxylate (speculated M2'). Compared with the metabolisms of imperatorin and isoimperatorin, it was found that the five metabolites were all transformed from these two major compounds present in the plant. Since no study on isoimperatorin metabolism by liver microsomal enzyme system has been reported so far, its metabolites (M1' and M3') were isolated by preparative HPLC for structure elucidation by (1) H-NMR and MS(2) analysis. M3' was identified as isoimperatorin epoxide, which is a new compound as far as its chemical structure is concerned. However, interestingly, M3' was not detected in the metabolism of the whole plant extract. In addition, a study with known chemical inhibitors on individual isozymes of the microsomal enzyme family revealed that CYP1A2 is involved in metabolisms of both isoimperatorin and imperatorin, and CYP3A4 only in that of isoimperatorin."", 'Biotransformation studies conducted on the furanocoumarins isoimperatorin (1) and imperatorin (3) have revealed that 1 was metabolized by Glomerella cingulata to give the corresponding reduced acid, 6,7-furano-5-prenyloxy hydrocoumaric acid (2), and 3 was transformed by G. cingulata to give the dealkylated metabolite, xanthotoxol (4) in high yields (83% and 81%), respectively. The structures of the new compound 2 have been established on the basis of spectral data. The metabolites 2 and 4 were tested for the beta-secretase (BACE1) inhibitory activity in vitro, and metabolite 2 slightly inhibited the beta-secretase activity with an IC(50) value of 185.6+/-6.8 uM. The metabolite 4 was less potent activity than compounds 1-3. In addition, methyl ester (2Me), methyl ether (2a) and methyl ester and ether (2aMe) of 2 were synthesized, and investigated for the ability to inhibit beta-secretase. Compound 2aMe exhibited the best beta-secretase inhibitory activity at the IC(50) value 16.2+/-1.2 uM and found to be the 2aMe showed competitive mode of inhibition against beta-secretase with K(i) value 11.3+/-2.8 uM.']",

This paper reports the bioavailability of sesamol in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Biological fluid was sampled following a dose of sesamol of 50 mg/kg by gastric gavage (p.o.) or by intravenous injection. The pharmacokinetic data of sesamol were calculated by noncompartmental model. The tissue distribution of sesamol (p.o., 100 mg/kg) in SD rats was also investigated. The concentration changes of sesamol were determined in various tissues and plasma within a 24 hr period after oral administration of sesamol. The results showed that the oral bioavailability of sesamol was 35.5 +/- 8.5%. Sesamol was found to be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and go through hepatobiliary excretion. Sesamol conjugated metabolites were widely distributed in SD rat tissues, with the highest concentrations in the liver and kidneys and the lowest in the brain. It is postulated that sesamol is incorporated into the liver first and then transported to the other tissues (lung, kidneys, and brain). The major metabolites of sesamol distributed in the lung and kidney were glucuronide and sulfate.']","[""Sesamol (3,4-methylenedioxyphenol), a phenolic constituent in roasted sesame, was reported to exhibit various beneficial activities. To understand the metabolic transformation of sesamol in vivo, rats were given sesamol intravenously and orally. The blood samples were withdrawn via cardiopuncture at specific time points. The serum samples were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography method before and after hydrolysis with sulfatase and beta-glucuronidase. Our results indicated that following either intravenous or oral administration, sesamol declined rapidly and the sulfate/glucuronide of sesamol emerged instantaneously. The peak serum concentration and systemic exposure of sesamol were markedly lower than sesamol sulfate/glucuronide. Ex vivo evaluation revealed that sesamol exerted profoundly higher capability against 2,2'-azo-bis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride-induced hemolysis than the serum metabolites. In conclusion, sulfate and glucuronide of sesamol were the principle metabolites of sesamol in the bloodstream of rats. The conjugated metabolites of sesamol warrant more bioactivity investigations to understand the in vivo effect of sesamol."", 'This paper reports the bioavailability of sesamol in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats...

However, glucose metabolism of cancer as reflected by Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation shows considerable variability. Depending on tumor type, stage, and location, Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation may be increased, normal, or decreased. Also, inflammatory cells can have the same variability of uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18. In the heart, under normal aerobic conditions, the myocardium meets the bulk of its energy requirements by oxidizing free fatty acids. Most of the exogenous glucose taken up by the myocyte is converted into glycogen. However, under ischemic conditions, the oxidation of free fatty acids decreases, exogenous glucose becomes the preferred myocardial substrate, glycolysis is stimulated, and glucose taken up by the myocyte is metabolized immediately instead of being converted into glycogen. Under these conditions, phosphorylated Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulates in the myocyte and can be detected with PET imaging. Normally, the brain relies on anaerobic metabolism. In epilepsy, the glucose metabolism varies. Generally, during a seizure glucose metabolism increases. Interictally, the seizure focus tends to be hypometabolic.']","['Compounds that are used in medicine as sources of radiation for radiotherapy and for diagnostic purposes.

Traditionally, teratogenic effects of antidepressants or other drugs have been noted as anatomic malformation.

However, it is possible for antidepressants to exert their effects on the fetus at other times during pregnancy as well as to infants during lactation. Administration of antidepressants to pregnant women presents a unique problem for the physician. Not only must maternal pharmacologic mechanisms be taken into consideration when prescribing an antidepressant drug, but the fetus must also be regarded as a potential recipient of the drug.

Technically, the term corticosteroid refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, but is often used as a synonym for glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors.

Exposed rats were serially killed and dissected so that the movement of the radiolabel could be traced over 7 days. Hydrolysis products cleared rapidly after noninhalation administration (t 1/2 <24 hr). The deposition of inhaled difluoro was mainly in the maxillo- and ethmoturbinates, and clearance was mainly by mucociliary clearance and swallowing. Constants were calculated for relating doses of difluoro to various respiratory tract tissues as a function of total deposited vapor. These constants indicate that the maxilloturbinates in the anterior of the nose receive more than four times the dose of difluoro than do the ethmoturbinates, whereas the trachea and lung receive much lower doses than do the nasal tissues. The derived constants may be applicable for calculating doses to respiratory tract tissues for other inhaled vapors that do not saturate the mucus (e.g, irreversibly react with water).']",,
