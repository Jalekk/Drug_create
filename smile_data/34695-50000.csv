Tissue residues detected after either a single oral dose of 0.5 mg/kg bw or administration of 6.6 ppm in the diet for one week were below 1 mg/kg, and these declined more rapidly after administration of the ring-labelled than the carbonyl-labelled compound.

Biliary radioactive carbon measurements made two days after administration revealed the following percentage of the dose 20.2%. /Most/ of the dose was eliminated in the urine, while the feces did not exceed an elimination rate of 3%. Enterohepatic circulation of metabolites is suggested by these findings.', 'A lactating Holstein cow and a male Yorkshire pig treated with a single oral dose (0.5 mg/kg) of ring (14C) croneton excreted 97.8% and 90.0% of the dose, respectively, in the urine after 24 hr. None of the swine tissues examined 24 hr after treatment contained detectable residues, and of the bovine tissues, only the kidney, liver, and skin contained detectable activity (0.016, 0.017, and 0.05 ppm 14C-croneton equivalents, respectively). Milk collected from the cow 6 hr after treatment contained 128 ppb 14C residues; 60% of this was as the free carbamate metabolites, croneton sulfoxide and sulfone. White Leghorn hens given ring 14C-croneton as a single oral dose (0.5 mg/kg) or in twice-daily doses (0.5 mg/kg) over 7 consecutive days showed patterns of metabolism and excretion similar to those observed in the pig and cow. Birds sacrificed 4 hr after the last dose contained from 0.019 ppm 14C-croneton equivalents in the fat to 0.324 ppm in the kidney. By 24 hr, only the liver and kidney (0.044 and 0.022 ppm, respectively) contained residues in excess of 0.01 ppm, and within 4 days the residues in these organs were 0.01 ppm or less. Residues in eggs laid by these hens were 0.03 to 0.04 ppm 14C-croneton equivalents 2 days after treatment; egg residues reached a maximum of 0.06 to 0.07 ppm 7 days after treatment and declined rapidly following the termination of treatment. About 75% of the radiocarbon in the eggs occurred as free phenol sulfoxide and sulfone, 10% occurred as free croneton sulfoxide and croneton sulfone, 5% occurred as water-soluble metabolites, and 5% occurred as unextracted residues. The remaining 5% was accounted for by unknown metabolites in the organo-extractable fraction.']","['The main metabolites are ethiofencarb sulfoxide and sulfone, ethiofencarb phenol and the corresponding sulfoxide and sulfone.', 'The first step in the metabolism of carbamates is hydrolysis to carbamic acid, which decomposes to carbon dioxide (CO2) and the corresponding amine. The mechanism of hydrolysis is different for  N -methyl and  N -dimethyl derivatives.  The  N -methyl carbamates pass through an isocyanate intermediate, whereas in the hydrolysis of  N - dimethylcarbamates, an addition product with a hydroxyl ion is formed yielding the alcohol and  N -dimethyl substituted acid.  The rate of hydrolysis by esterases is faster in mammals than in plants and insects. Apart from hydrolysis, oxidation also takes place including: hydroxylation of the aromatic ring,  O -dealkylation,  N -methyl hydroxylation,  N -dealkylation, oxidation of aliphatic side chains, and sulfoxidation to the corresponding sulfone. Oxidation is associated with the mixed-function oxidase (MFO) enzymes. Conjugation leads to the formation of  O - and  N -glucuronides, sulfates, and mercapturic acid derivatives in mammals.  Glycosides and phosphates are conjugation products more common in plants. /Carbamate Pesticides/', 'The fate of Croneton, 2-ethylthiomethylphenyl N-methylcarbamate, was determined in rats following single oral or dietary exposure to the 14C-carbonyl- and 14C-ring-labeled insecticide. Greater than 95% of the (14C)Croneton equivalents was excreted in the urine or as a combination of 14CO2 (47%) and urinary products (41%) 72 hr after a single oral dose. The feces contained 27% of the dose. A similar excretion pattern was observed during a 7-day feeding period. The principal urinary metabolites were Croneton sulfoxide (23-28% of the dose), phenol sulfoxide (20-23%), phenol sulfone (9-25%), and Croneton sulfone (3-11%) after a single oral dose and similar in the long term study. The carbamates were excreted primarily as free metabolites while the phenolic constituents were eliminated as acid labile conjugates.', 'The comparative ester hydrolysis and selective toxicity of carbamate insecticides were studied in 4 mammalian species. Hydrolysis rates of carbaryl and ethiofencarb (Croneton) were examined in the rat, mouse, guinea pig and gerbil. Respiratory 14CO2 resulting from the hydrolysis of orally administered (carbonyl-14C)carbamates (0.2 mg/kg) was taken as measure of in vivo hydrolytic capabilities. Ester hydrolysis was greater for ethiofencarb in all species tested, although the relative order of hydrolysis among species was the same with both compounds. After 24 hr, gerbils had hydrolyzed 91% of the ethiofencarb an 65% of the carbaryl. Guinea pigs hydrolyzed somewhat less of the compounds, 65 and 85%, but more than rats and mice, 40 and 25%.', 'About 75% of the radiocarbon in the eggs /from White Leghorn hens given one to 14 oral doses of croneton/ occurred as free phenol sulfoxide and sulfone, 10% occurred as free croneton sulfoxide and croneton sulfone, 5% occurred as water-soluble metabolites, and 5% occurred as unextracted residues.

In one limited study in neonates and infants younger than 3 months of age, total body clearance of the drug averaged 0.65 l/hr per kg in those 14 days of age or younger and 1.14 l/hr per kg in those older than 14 days of age."", ""Zidovudine is rapidly metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver to zidovudine 5'-O-glucuronide (GAZT); the metabolite has an apparent elimination half life of 1 hour (range: 0.6-1.7 hours).

UGT2B7 is the primary UGT isoform that is responsible for glucuronidation. Compared to zidovudine, GZDV's area under the curve is approximately 3-fold greater. The cytochrome P450 isozymes are responsible for the reduction of the azido moiety to form 3'-amino-3'- deoxythymidine (AMT)."", 'Zidovudine is rapidly metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver principally to 3-azido-3-deoxy-5-O-beta-d-glucopyranuronosylthymidine (GZDV; formerly GAZT); zidovudine is also metabolized to GZDV in renal microsomes. GZDV has an apparent elimination half-life of 1 hour (range: 0.6-1.7 hours) and does not appear to have antiviral activity against HIV. In addition, two other hepatic metabolites of zidovudine have been identified as 3-amino-3-deoxythymidine (AMT) and its glucuronide derivative (GAMT). Intracellularly, in both virus-infected and uninfected cells, zidovudine is converted to zidovudine monophosphate by cellular thymidine kinase; the monophosphate derivative is phosphorylated to zidovudine diphosphate via cellular dTMP kinase (thymidylate kinase) and then to zidovudine triphosphate via other cellular enzymes. Intracellular (host cell) conversion of zidovudine to the triphosphate derivative is necessary for the antiviral activity of the drug. Activation for antibacterial action, however, does not depend on phosphorylation within host cells but rather depends on conversion within bacterial cells.', 'The mechanisms of intestinal mucosal transport and metabolism of zidovudine and other thymidine analogs were studied. No zidovudine metabolites appeared in any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Other thymidine analogs were rapidly metabolized in the upper gastrointestinal tract, but not in the colon.']","['Elimination half life, HIV-infected patients, IV administration = 1.1 hours (range of 0.5 - 2.9 hours)', 'The plasma half-life of zidovudine in adults averages approximately 0.53 hours following oral or IV administration. Following IV administration of zidovudine in adults or children, plasma concentrations of the drug appear to decline in a biphasic manner. Half-life in adults is less than 10 minutes in the initial phase and 1 hour in the terminal phase.  Following IV administration over 1 hour of a single 80-, 120-, or 160-mg/sq m , dose in children 1-13 years of age with symptomatic HIV infection, the alpha half-life of zidovudine averaged 0.16-0.25 hours and the beta half-life averaged 1-1.7 hours. Plasma half-life of zidovudine generally is longer in neonates than in older children and adults but decreases with neonatal maturity. In one limited study in neonates and infants younger than 3 months of age, plasma half-life of zidovudine averaged 3.1 hours in those 14 days of age or younger and 1.9 hours in those older than 14 days of age. In a study in premature neonates (26-32 weeks gestation; birthweight 0.7-1.9 kg), the serum half-life of zidovudine averaged 7.3 hours at an average postnatal age of 6.3 days and averaged 4.4 hours at an average postnatal age of 17.7 days.', 'The value for half-life of zidovudine is 1-2 hr.']"

As part of a larger study examining the effects of PBDEs on mink (Mustela vison) reproduction and development, ... congener-specific tissue distribution, maternal transfer, biotransformation, and biomagnification of the technical penta-BDE mixture, DE-71, /were examined/ in farmed mink. Adult female mink were fed one of four concentrations of DE-71 (0-2.5 ug/g) in the diet from breeding through gestation and until weaning at 6 weeks postparturition. Parent PBDEs were measured in tissues and excreta of adult mink, kits, and juveniles, whereas hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs) were measured in juveniles only. Similar lipid-normalized concentrations of PBDEs were detected in most tissues of adult mink with the exception of brain, in which concentrations were significantly lower. Kits, however, had a higher proportion of PBDEs in brain compared with adults, presumably because of incomplete development of the blood-brain barrier. Maternal transfer favored lower-brominated PBDE congeners, and the bulk of the body burden in kits at weaning resulted from lactational rather than transplacental transfer. Lipid-normalized, whole-body biomagnification factors ranged from 0.5 to 5.2 for the major congeners and were highest for BDEs 47 and 153. Metabolism clearly limited the biomagnification of some PBDEs, and OH-PBDEs were detectable in plasma, liver, and feces. On a mass basis, OH-PBDEs accounted for 28 to 32% of the excreted fraction, indicating metabolism was an important elimination pathway. /DE-71/', 'Using rats as a model, ... tissue distribution of PBDEs /was investigated/ after oral administration and ... a suitable matrix /was evaluated/ for body burden estimation. Male rats were administered dust or corn oil containing 8 or 6 ug PBDEs/kg bw, respectively, in the diet for 21 days (N=4 rats per treatment), and the concentration of 15 PBDEs were measured in various tissues, plasma, and feces. PBDEs were found in all tissues, including the brain, and showed no difference in distribution patterns between treatments for most PBDEs. Tri- to hexa-BDEs comprised >80% of the total PBDEs in the adipose, brain, kidney, lung, and residual carcass, but <40% in the liver and plasma. The ratio of the lipid-weight concentration of tri- to hexa-BDEs in adipose tissue, residual carcass, and plasma was 1:1:2. For the hepta- to nona-BDEs, lipid-weight concentrations increased from adipose tissue to residual carcass to plasma in the ratio 0.3:1:>4. BDE-209 was the dominant congener in the liver and plasma, but was not detected in the adipose tissue or carcass. In summary, the lower brominated congeners tended to distribute equally into lipids implying both adipose tissue and plasma would be suitable matrices for biomonitoring. Plasma was the best matrix for detection of the higher brominated congeners (especially BDE-209), although on a lipid-weight basis tended to overestimate the total body burdens.', 'Male and female rats were given a single oral dose of 300 mg/kg Bromkal 70 in peanut oil. Control groups were given vehicle only. Groups of 4 rats of either sex were sacrificed at weekly intervals up to 10 weeks post-dosing for HPLC and GC/MS analysis of the brominated diphenyl ether content of perirenal fat. The results showed the presence of two isomers of pentaBPDE in the perirenal fat, pentaBDPE1 and pentaBDPE2, in addition to tetra- and hexabromodiphenyl ethers. The half-lives of elimination of the pentaBDPE isomers ranged from 25-47 days in males and females respectively.

The microsomes were subsequently incubated in vitro with 1 of 2 pure congeners of pentaBDPE (BDE-47 or BDE-99) (concentration not reported) in the presence of NADPH for 30 min. The microsomes suspension was then used in T4-TTr competion binding studies. The limited results presented (qualitative tabulated information only) indicate that both BDE-47 and BDE-99 inhibit T4-TTr binding in penobarbitol induced microsomes by approx. 60 and 20%, respectively suggesting that the parent molecule may be metabolized to hydroxylated metabolites. /BDE-47 and BDE-99/', ""Groups of 6 conventional and 6 bile-cannulated Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a single oral dose of 2.2 mg/ rat 2,2',4,4',5-{14C}pentaBDPE (BDE-99) in peanut oil.

It has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including _Enterobacteriaceae_, _Escherichia coli_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, _Morganella morganii_, _Moraxella lacunata_, _Proteus_ spp., _Haemophilus_ spp., _Acinetobacter_ spp., _Neisseria_ spp., and, importantly, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_. Aminoglycosides also generally retain activity against the biothreat agents _Yersinia pestis_ and _Francisella tularensis_. In addition, aminoglycosides are active against some Gram-positive bacteria such as _Staphylococcus_ spp., including methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant strains, _Streptococcus_ spp., and _Mycobacterium_ spp.  Like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is taken up and retained by proximal tubule and cochlear cells in the kidney and ear, respectively, and hence carries a risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. There is also a risk of neuromuscular block, which may be more pronounced in patients with preexisting neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson's disease. Aminoglycosides can cross the placenta, resulting in total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in babies born to mothers who were administered an aminoglycoside during pregnancy. Due to the low systemic absorption of inhaled and topical tobramycin formulations, these effects are more pronounced with injected tobramycin than with other formulations. However, all formulations carry a risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including potentially fatal cutaneous reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.""]",['Substances that inhibit the growth or reproduction of BACTERIA.

In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or ""bundles"" of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.']",,"['When a 24 hour infusion of 135 mg/m^2 is given to ovarian cancer patients, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) is 195 ng/mL, while the AUC is 6300 ng•h/mL.', 'In 5 patients administered a 225 or 250 mg/m2 dose of radiolabeled paclitaxel as a 3-hour infusion, a mean of 71% of the radioactivity was excreted in the feces in 120 hours, and 14% was recovered in the urine.', '227 to 688 L/m^2 [apparent volume of distribution at steady-state, 24 hour infusion]', '21.7 L/h/m2 [Dose 135 mg/m2, infusion duration 24 h]', 'Paclitaxel bound to nanoparticles of the serum protein albumin is delivered via endothelial transport mediated by albumin receptors, and the resulting concentration of paclitaxel in tumor cells is increased compared with that achieved using an equivalent dose of conventional paclitaxel.

As in humans, no metabolites of taxol were detected by HPLC in rat urine, and only 10% of the injected taxol was recovered in urine over a 24 hr period. In contrast, 11.5% and 29% of the injected taxol was recovered in rat bile as unchanged taxol and metabolites, respectively. Among the nine taxol metabolites detected by HPLC, the side chain at C13, which is required for pharmacological activity, had been removed in only one minor metabolite, baccatin III. The chemical structures of the two major hydroxylated metabolites were determined by MS (fast atom bombardment and desorption chemical ionization) and (1)H NMR spectroscopy. One was a taxol derivative hydroxylated on the phenyl group at C3 of the side chain at C13, while the other corresponded to a taxol derivative hydroxylated in the m-position on the benzoate of the side chain at C2. Although these two major taxol metabolites were as active as taxol in preventing cold microtubule disassembly, they were, respectively, 9 and 39 times less cytotoxic as taxol on in vitro L1210 leukemia growth. These results show for the first time that there is a significant hepatic metabolism of taxol.', ""To investigate how taxane's substituents at C3' affect its metabolism, ... the metabolism of cephalomannine and paclitaxel, a pair of analogs that differ slightly at the C3' position /was compared/. After cephalomannine was incubated with human liver microsomes in an NADPH-generating system, two monohydroxylated metabolites (M1 and M2) were detected by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. C4'' (M1) and C6alpha (M2) were proposed as the possible hydroxylation sites, and the structure of M1 was confirmed by (1)H NMR. Chemical inhibition studies and assays with recombinant human cytochromes P450 (P450s) indicated that 4''-hydroxycephalomannine was generated predominantly by CYP3A4 and 6alpha-hydroxycephalomannine by CYP2C8. The overall biotransformation rate between paclitaxel and cephalomannine differed slightly (184 vs. 145 pmol/min/mg), but the average ratio of metabolites hydroxylated at the C13 side chain to C6alpha for paclitaxel and cephalomannine varied significantly (15:85 vs. 64:36) in five human liver samples. Compared with paclitaxel, the major hydroxylation site transferred from C6alpha to C4'', and the main metabolizing P450 changed from CYP2C8 to CYP3A4 for cephalomannine. In the incubation system with rat or minipig liver microsomes, only 4''-hydroxycephalomannine was detected, and its formation was inhibited by CYP3A inhibitors. Molecular docking by AutoDock suggested that cephalomannine adopted an orientation in favor of 4''-hydroxylation, whereas paclitaxel adopted an orientation favoring 3'-p-hydroxylation. Kinetic studies showed that CYP3A4 catalyzed cephalomannine more efficiently than paclitaxel due to an increased V(m). Our results demonstrate that relatively minor modification of taxane at C3' has major consequence on the metabolism.""]","['When a 24 hour infusion of 135 mg/m^2 is given to ovarian cancer patients, the elimination half=life is 52.7 hours.', '5.3-17.4 hours after 1 and 6 hour  infusions at dosing levels of 15-275 mg/sq m', 'Following IV infusion of paclitaxel over periods ranging from 6-24 hours in adults with malignancy, plasma concentrations of paclitaxel appeared to decline in a biphasic manner in some studies, with an average distribution half-life  of 0.34 hours and an average elimination half-life of 5.8 hours.

In vivo metabolism of HC Blue 2 yielded a single major metabolite peak which was not hydrolyzed by glucuronidase. Metabolism by B6C3Fl mouse hepatocytes yielded metabolite profiles which were qualitatively similar to the profiles observed after in vivo metabolism. HC Blue 1 was metabolized by hepatocytes at approximately twice the rate of HC Blue 2. Cytogenetic evaluations of mouse hepatocytes after in vitro treatment indicated HC Blue 1 was more potent than HC Blue 2 in inducing chromosomal aberrations while both chemicals showed weak activity for inducing sister-chromatid exchanges.

In rats, individual congeners (mono- to hexachlorobiphenyls) were readily absorbed when administered by gavage (vehicle not reported) in doses between 5 and 100 mg/kg. Retention was > 90% of the administered dose over a 4 day period, and was apparently dose independent. No relationship between substitution pattern and degree of absorption could be established due to the low levels of excretion, although a later study reported that absorption efficiency decreased in rats as the number of chlorine atoms increased such that dichlorobiphenyls were absorbed with a 95% efficiency, whereas octachlorobiphenyls had an absorption efficiency of only 75%. Results similar to those obtained in rats were reported in monkeys administered a single dose of 1.5 or 3.0 g Aroclor 1248/kg by gavage and in ferrets given 0.05 mg (14)C-labeled Aroclor 1254 in the food on days 14 and 35 of gestation. Retention was estimated to be > 90% and 85.4% of the administered dose in the monkeys and ferrets, respectively. Over 90% of a single dose of 10 mg PCB 105 was absorbed by minks. In mice, absorption of a gavage dose of 8 mg/kg of PCB 52 /2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl/ or 100 mg/kg of PCB 77 /3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl/ was rapid, with serum concentrations increasing 4-7-fold in 30-60 minutes; peak serum concentrations were achieved 2 hours after dosing."", 'In monkeys, a single dose of 1.5 or 3.0 g/kg Aroclor 1248 resulted in a dose-dependent liver concentration of Aroclor 1248 (25 or 53 ug/g) 2 times higher than that found in the kidney (12 or 27 ug/g) and brain (17 or 28 ug/g) 4 days after dosing. This difference was greatly increased 14 days after treatment due to both a reduction in kidney and brain concentration and an increase in liver concentration. The blood levels of Aroclor 1254 increased rapidly in monkeys during 10 months of treatment (from approximately 1.2 ug/g at time zero to about 100 ug/g in the high-dose group) with doses between 20 and 80 ug/kg/day, but this increase leveled off during the remaining 27 months of treatment. A dose of 5 ug/kg/day induced only a slight increase in blood PCB levels during the total treatment period of 37 months. When the data were expressed as relative concentration, it appeared that absorption and bioaccumulation were dose-dependent. However, the concentration/dose levels were, to some extent, affected by background PCB levels of the control group, which would have a greater impact on the relative concentrations of the lowest dose groups rather than on the higher dose groups.', '4 wk after ip injection of 1 g Aroclor 1248 into rats, adipose tissue contained 338 ug tetrachlorinated biphenyl (TCB) residues/g, and there was a shift to pentachlorobiphenyls and hexachlorobiphenyls (up to 63%) in chromatographic and spectrometric analysis patterns of residue. Only 5% of higher chlorinated components were present in the TCB admin.', 'Over 90% of a single oral dose (1.5 or 3.0 g/kg body weight) of Aroclor 1248 was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of monkeys as determined by chromatographic analysis of excreta. The major route was by biliary excretion into the gastrointestinal tract. By the 14th day after PCB administration, 5.6% of the original dose had been eliminated in the urine and feces.']",,

Biliary excretion of unchanged drug and/or metabolites is an important route of etoposide elimination as fecal recovery of radioactivity is 44% of the intravenous dose. 56% of the dose was in the urine, 45% of which was excreted as etoposide.', 'The disposition of etoposide is a biphasic process with a distribution half-life of 1.5 hours.

The total plasma clearance rate (342-435 mL/min per sq m) and the distribution volume (22-27 L/sq m) were not dose-dependent. The peak plasma concentration occurred at the end of the infusion of etoposide phosphate, indicating rapid conversion of the pro-drug to etoposide.', 'Less than 4% of a dose was recovered in the bile after 48 hr in patients with biliary drainage tubes.

Prostaglandin synthases are also responsible for the conversion of etoposide to O-demethylated metabolites (quinone).', 'The proposed hydroxy acid metabolite of etoposide, formed by opening of the lactone ring, has been detected in human urine, but only at low concentrations, accounting for 0.2-2.2% of the administered dose.', 'The major urinary metabolite of etoposide in humans is reported to be the glucuronide conjugate. Although urinary glucuronide and/or sulfate conjugates were reported to account for 5-22% of an intravenous dose of etoposide, other studies suggest that the glucuronide predominates.

In patients with renal or liver impairment given somewhat lower doses of 70-150 mg/sq m, 3-17% of the dose was excreted in the urine within 72 hr as etoposide glucuronide.', 'Etoposide appears to be metabolized principally at the D ring to produce the resulting hydroxy acid (probably the trans-hydroxy acid); this metabolite appears to be pharmacologically inactive.

Etoposide is administered as the trans-lactone, but cis-etoposide can also be detected in human urine. This might be a storage phenomenon, since isomerization sometimes occurs during freezing of plasma samples under slightly basic conditions. The cis isomer accounts for < 1% of the dose. The catechol metabolite has also been reported in patients receiving 600 mg/sq m etoposide, with an AUC of around 2.5% that of etoposide.

After intravenous injection of 3(H)etoposide to rabbits, the total urinary excretion of radiolabel was 30% after five days, with very little thereafter.

Sucralose (Splenda) currently holds the majority of the NNS market share and is often combined with acesulfame-potassium in a wide variety of foods and beverages. To date, saccharin is the only NNS reported to be found in human breast milk after maternal consumption, while there is no apparent information on the other NNS. Breast milk samples were collected from 20 lactating volunteers, irrespective of their habitual NNS intake. Saccharin, sucralose, and acesulfame-potassium were present in 65% of participants' milk samples, whereas aspartame was not detected. These data indicate that NNS are frequently ingested by nursing infants, and thus prospective clinical studies are necessary to determine whether early NNS exposure via breast milk may have clinical implications. /Acesulfame potassium/"", 'Single oral doses of 10 mg (14)C-Acesulfame K/kg bw given to rats and dogs were rapidly absorbed.

Three days after dosing, the concn in the organs and plasma was 0.4 nMol/g in liver, and  <0.2  nMol/g in other tissues. Seven days after dosing, the concn in dogs was <0.2 nMol/g in all tissues examined. /Acesulfame K/', 'After pretreatment for seven days with a diet containing 3% Acesulfame K, male rats were given a dose of 250 mg Acesulfame K containing (14)C-Acesulfame K (9.6 x 108 dpm) by oral gavage. After eight hours the animals were killed and liver and spleen excised; DNA and chromatin protein was isolated from these organs. No radioactivity could be detected on any DNA sample. A low level of activity (8-11 dpm/mg protein) was associated with chromatin protein and this was claimed to be due to non-covalent interactions of unchanged Acesulfame K. /Acesulfame K/', 'Single oral doses of approximately 15 mg (14)C-Acesulfame K/kg bw were administered to male and female rats which had been pretreated with unlabeled Acesulfame K at a level of 300 mg/kg diet for 60 days.

Plasma concentrations of AcK reached maximal levels within 45 minutes and rapidly declined following oral doses. Plasma AcK were below limits of detection by 480 minutes post dose. A second peak was also observed following oral administration, suggesting enterohepatic recirculation. Following IV and PO administration, 45% (males) and 70% (females) of the dose was excreted in urine by 24 hr. Oral bioavailability was estimated to be 90-100% based on urinary data.']"

Isoproturon was rapidly absorbed and attained blood concentration within 15 min of administration. The kinetic behavior followed a two-compartment open model. The higher half-life (beta) (9.78 +/- 0.33 hr) and V(d)()area (4.49 +/- 0.41 L/kg) associated with lower Cl(B) (0.32 +/- 0.02 L/kg/hr) suggested slow elimination from the blood. Approximately 56% of the total administered compound was recovered from feces. The rate of excretion of isoproturon through feces was maximum at 48 hr and could not be detected beyond 120 hr. The excretion pattern of isoproturon through urine resembled that of feces, and approximately 10-11% was eliminated in urine. A maximum quantity of residue was detected in all tissues of goats slaughtered after 4 days followed by a substantial decline after day 5, and nothing could be detected after day 7. Histopathological study revealed that isoproturon produced moderate cellular changes like fatty degeneration in the liver and kidney and emphysema in the lung after 7 days post administration.']","['Using ring-(14)C-labeled isoproturon (1 ug/L), the uptake into spawn and tadpoles of Bombina bombina and Bombina variegata was investigated. Two percent of the applied radioactivity was found per gram fresh weight in the embryo after 24 hr. Results indicate that the jelly mass of the spawn does not act as a sufficient physical barrier for protection against the uptake and influence of isoproturon (IPU) on the embryo. In vivo metabolism of ring-(14)C-labeled IPU by the cytochrome P-450 system was analyzed in tadpoles. Different metabolites of IPU, such as N-demethylated and C-hydroxylated derivatives, and the olefinic metabolite were detected. In tadpoles of B. variegata, the activity of microsomal and soluble glutathione-S-transferase (sGSTs) toward different model substrates was measured after treatment with IPU. Activities of sGST increased corresponding to elevated stress by IPU dependent on exposure time and dose. Compared to the pure active ingredient IPU, the commercial phenyl-urea herbicide Tolkan Flo, consisting of IPU and an emulsifier, also caused significantly elevated enzymatic response.']","['Toxicokinetic behavior and recoveries of isoproturon from feces, urine, and different tissues of goat were determined after 4, 5, 6, and 7 days following single oral administration at 500 mg/kg. ...

The mechanism of hydrolysis is different for  N -methyl and  N -dimethyl derivatives.  The  N -methyl carbamates pass through an isocyanate intermediate, whereas in the hydrolysis of  N - dimethylcarbamates, an addition product with a hydroxyl ion is formed yielding the alcohol and  N -dimethyl substituted acid.  The rate of hydrolysis by esterases is faster in mammals than in plants and insects. Apart from hydrolysis, oxidation also takes place including: hydroxylation of the aromatic ring,  O -dealkylation,  N -methyl hydroxylation,  N -dealkylation, oxidation of aliphatic side chains, and sulfoxidation to the corresponding sulfone. Oxidation is associated with the mixed-function oxidase (MFO) enzymes. Conjugation leads to the formation of  O - and  N -glucuronides, sulfates, and mercapturic acid derivatives in mammals.  Glycosides and phosphates are conjugation products more common in plants. /Carbamate Pesticides/']",['The half-life in the rat is of the order of 3-8 hr.']

The results were considered in connection with the toxicity of these compounds. Teflubenzuron was 10 times more toxic than diflubenzuron to fourth instar larvae of spodoptera littoralis. Profenofos and S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate synergized both diflubenzuron and teflubenzuron, indicating that the major route of detoxification in spodoptera littoralis was through hydrolysis. Limited synergism by piperonly butoxide indicated that mixed function oxidase enzymes play a relatively small role in benzoyphenylureas detoxification. ... In Spodoptera littoralis, diflubenzuron was metabolized more rapidly than teflubenzuron: based on the relative amount of parent compound present in the larval body, about 58% of extracted radiocarbon was unchanged teflubenzuron compared to only 38% diflubenzuron. In the excreta, unchanged teflubenzuron was excreted more slowly than the metabolites (42% recovered as parent compound), compared to diflubenzuron in which 79% of the total extract was present as parent compound. Pretreatment of the fourth instar with sublethal doses of profenofos resulted in a significant decrease in metabolism, more so with diflubenzuron than with teflubenzuron. A positive correlation was found between in vivo diflubenzuron metabolism inhibition and toxicity. In in vitro assays, diflubenzuron was hydrolyzed more rapidly than teflubenzuron by all tissue extracts. Profenofos was more effective in inhibiting the hydrolysis in vitro of diflubenzuron compared to teflubenzuron, as indicated by a lower I50 value and steeper slope. /The/  results indicate that reduced penetration and fast elimination of unchanged (14)(C)diflubenzuron together with rapid metabolism, which occurs mainly through hydrolysis, are defense mechanisms which contribute to diflubenzuron detoxification in spodoptera littoralis.', ""After oral treatment of a cow and a castrated sheep with labeled diflubenzuron, urine was collected and analyzed.

The high fecal excretion suggests poor absorption. Of the radioactive body burden, 50% was contained in the liver. The microsomal fractioncontained 96.3 (+ or - 8.2)% of the hepatic radioactivity.', 'The polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and the polychlorinated dibenzofurans are predominantly stored in fat, but they are also excreted in milk and pass the placenta. They also appear in the blood and vital organs at lower concentrations. /Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/', ""A defined mixture of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans was subcutaneously administered to a pregnant marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) 11 wk prior to delivery. Transfer of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans via placenta and mother's milk was investigated by measurement of concn in a newborn 1 day after birth and in an infant of the same litter after a lactation period of 33 days. Furthermore, comparative measurements were performed in different tissues of the mother at the end of the lactation period, and in addition, in two groups of four adult monkeys each 1 and 6 wk after treatment. Deposition of the polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans into fell liver was very low for most of the 2,3,7,8-substituted congeners. Highest deposition was observed for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins. For all other compounds concn in the hepatic tissue of newborn shortly after birth were lower than one tenth of corresponding concn in adults. Fetal liver isapparently largely unable to accumulate polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans. In contrast to liver, concn of 2,3,7,8-substituted polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans in adipose tissue of the newborn were at least one third of the levels in adults. However, concn of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and octachlorodibenzofuran were about three times higher in the newborn than in adult adipose tissue. Transfer of some of the 2,3,7,8-substituted polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans to the offspring via mother's milk was considerable, leading to hepatic concn in the suckled infant at the end of the 33-day nursing period well above corresponding concn in the dam. When hepatic concn in the infant and dam were compared 2- to 4-fold higher concn were found in the infant's liver for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins/furans and for 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins. In the case of the 2,3,7,8-substituted hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins, hepatic concn in the infant and dam were in the same range at the end of the suckling period. In contrast to this, less than one tenth the concn of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was found in the infant's liver when compared with adult liver. /Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins/"", 'The tissue distribution of 2,3,7,8-chlorine substituted dibenzo-p-dioxins was conducted in 11 patients who died of cancer. The concn of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was the highest in each organ and tissue and heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins was also found at relatively high levels, second only to octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. The levels of 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins in the spleen were the highest, respectively. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins was also detected and its concn was the highest in the gonad (0.8-3.2 picogram/g range). From the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalent calculations, the highest equivalent value was obtained from a 54-year old female who died of cancerous goiter.

Hepatic accumulation was associated with alterations of several biochemical parameters. In animals treated 65 times, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity was elevated 40 fold over controls; total cytochrome p450 content doubled and exhibited a 2 nanometer blue shift in the Soret maximum for the reduced hemoprotein-CO complex. Cytochrome p450c and cytochrome p450d were significantly increased, while cytochrome p450b levels were unaltered. Nearly all the dioxin congeners present in liver were represented by octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, with a slight amount ofheptachlorinated dioxin present. It was concluded that subchronic octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin exposure causes toxic effects similar to those observed with other dioxins, but with far less potency than 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. /Octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin/']","['The half-lives of 1,2,3,6,7,8-Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin /were calculated/ to be about 3.5, 3.6 and 2 years, respectively. The estimation was based on the analysis of fat tissue biopsies collected with an interval of 28 months from one 14 year old girl who for a period of about 2-3 years had been exposed to technical pentachlorophenol.']"

Male rats were administered dust or corn oil containing 8 or 6 ug PBDEs/kg bw, respectively, in the diet for 21 days (N=4 rats per treatment), and the concentration of 15 PBDEs were measured in various tissues, plasma, and feces. PBDEs were found in all tissues, including the brain, and showed no difference in distribution patterns between treatments for most PBDEs. Tri- to hexa-BDEs comprised >80% of the total PBDEs in the adipose, brain, kidney, lung, and residual carcass, but <40% in the liver and plasma. The ratio of the lipid-weight concentration of tri- to hexa-BDEs in adipose tissue, residual carcass, and plasma was 1:1:2. For the hepta- to nona-BDEs, lipid-weight concentrations increased from adipose tissue to residual carcass to plasma in the ratio 0.3:1:>4. BDE-209 was the dominant congener in the liver and plasma, but was not detected in the adipose tissue or carcass. In summary, the lower brominated congeners tended to distribute equally into lipids implying both adipose tissue and plasma would be suitable matrices for biomonitoring. Plasma was the best matrix for detection of the higher brominated congeners (especially BDE-209), although on a lipid-weight basis tended to overestimate the total body burdens.', ""The disposition of the 14C-labelled polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexaBDE (BDE153) was investigated in rodents following single and multiple doses and in a mixture with radiolabelled 2,2',4,4'-tetraBDE (BDE47) and 2,2',4,4',5-pentaBDE (BDE99). In single exposure studies there was little or no effect of dose on BDE153 disposition in male rats in the range 1-100 umol/kg. No major sex or species differences in the in vivo fate of BDE153 were detected. BDE153 was absorbed in rats or mice following gavage by approximately 70%; retained in tissues; and poorly metabolized and slowly excreted. Mixture studies indicated that, relative to each other, more BDE47 was distributed to adipose tissue, more BDE153 accumulated in the liver, and BDE99 was metabolized to the greatest extent. BDE153 was probably retained in the liver due to minimal metabolism and elimination after first-pass distribution to the tissue following gavage."", 'Twelve paired samples of maternal and cord blood collected in 2001 from women presenting in labor in an Indiana hospital were analyzed for six tetra- to heptaBDE congeners. None of the mothers had work-related potential for exposure to PBDEs, and none smoked. ... TetraBDE-47 was the most abundant congener, followed by pentaBDE-99, pentaBDE-100, and hexaBDE-153. PBDE concentrations were highly correlated between mother and fetal sera, indicating that PBDEs cross the placenta into the fetal circulation. In addition, the results indicate that all tetra- through hepta-substituted congeners have approximately the same potential to cross the placenta. There was a decreasing trend in concentration of PBDE congeners in maternal and fetal sera with increasing degree of bromination.', 'In F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice, about 30% of the radiolabel was found in the feces 24 hours after administration of a single radiolabeled 0.6 mg/kg dose compared to 4% in animals that received the same dose intravenously.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for Hexabromodiphenyl ethers (7 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","[""A metabolism study of orally administered 2,2',4,4',5,6'-hexabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-154; 11.3 umoles/kg) was conducted in conventional and bile duct-cannulated male Sprague-Dawley rats. In conventional rats, approximately 31% of the radiolabeled dose was retained at 72 hr, and lipophilic tissues were the preferred sites for disposition. Urinary excretion of BDE-154 was very low (1.0%), and parent compound was detected. Cumulative biliary excretion was 1.3%, and glutathione conjugates were suggested. Over 62% of the dose in conventional male rats was excreted in feces, and was composed of parent compound (7.3%), free metabolites (13.1%), and covalently bound residues (41.4%). Fecal metabolites characterized by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry included multiple isomers of monohydroxylated hexa-/penta-/tetrabromodiphenyl ethers, and di-hydroxylated hexa/pentabromodiphenyl ethers. The adipose tissue carbon-14 was extractable BDE-154, but 40% of liver carbon-14 was bound to macromolecules ..."", ""Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were fed a diet containing a mixture of 11 structurally diverse brominated flame retardants (BFRs) at nominal concentrations of either 1 or 100 nmol/g for up to 42 d, followed by an elimination period of 14 d. Uptake rates and elimination constants for five of the BFRs were calculated from measurements of their concentrations in the male fish during the exposure and elimination phases. Observed uptake efficiencies were highest for 2,4,4'-tribromodiphenyl ether (BDE 28) and 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2-dibromoethyl)cyclohexane (TBECH) and were lowest for decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 209). Estimated half-lives for TBECH and 2,4,6-tribromophenol were short (<2 d). Four BFR metabolites were identified in the fish: 2,2',3,4',5',6-hexabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 149), 2,2',4,4',5,6'-hexabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 154), 2,4,6-tribromoanisole, and 1,2,4,5-hexabromobenzene. These metabolites were still present in the zebrafish after the 14-d elimination period. No relationship between the BFR concentrations in the zebrafish and their log octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) values was found. Generally, low tendencies to bioaccumulate were observed for perbrominated and hydroxylated compounds. The observed accumulation of BFR metabolites in fish, however, shows that low concentration of a BFR does not provide, in isolation, a sound indication that the BFR poses low risks."", 'In F344 rats, almost all of the radiolabel in feces appeared to be parent compound in the 24-hr period after administration of BDE-153 on 1, 3, or 10 consecutive days or an equimolar mixture of BDE-47, -99, and -153 on 1 or 3 consecutive days. The total radiolabel extracted from the liver after 1 or 3 days of BDE-153 treatment was 85 +/- 1% or 94 +/- 1%, respectively. Unrecovered radioactivity (about 5-10%) was considered to be metabolites bound to liver proteins, and recovered material was considered to be unmetabolized BDE-153 dissolved in liver lipids and not yet transported to other tissues. /BDE-153/', '/An/ examination of the radiolabel in the feces and urine from mice exposed to 1 mg/kg-day BDE-153 intravenously /was performed/. In mice, about two-thirds of the label in the feces and four-fifths of that in the urine were identified as metabolites. Metabolites were extracted, separated using chromatography, and identified by mass spectroscopy. Three isomers were identified as monohydroxylated metabolites that retained all six bromines. Two isomers were identified as monohydroxylated metabolites that had lost one bromine. A single monohydroxylated isomer that had lost two bromines was identified as well as a trace amount of a sulfur-containing metabolite ...']","['The half-life of pentabromodiphenyl ether (Bromkal 70) was investigated in the perirenal fat of groups of 3 male and 3 female Wistar rats (weight 160-180 g), following a single oral dose of 300 mg/kg body weight in peanut oil. The groups were killed on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 and then weekly for 10 weeks. Perirenal fat was collected and analysed. Half-lives in male and female rats of 2 hexabromodiphenyl ethers (HxBDE(1) and HxBDE(2)) were: for female rats, 44.6 (37.4-51.9) days and 90.0 (78.7-103.6) days, and, for male rats, 55.1 (48.4-61.7) and 119.1 (102.8-136.1) days, respectively.']"

The average time to reach Cmax was 2 hours after oral administration of 1200 mg ribavirin. The oral bioavailability is 64% following a single oral dose administration of 600mg ribavirin.', 'The metabolites of ribavirin are renally excreted. After the oral administration of 600mg radiolabeled ribavirin, approximately 61% of the drug was detected in the urine and 12% was detected in the feces. 17% of administered dose was in unchanged form.', 'Ribavirin displays a large volume of distribution.', 'The total apparent clearance rate after a single oral dose administration of 1200 mg ribavirin is 26L/h.', 'Ribavirin is absorbed systemically from the respiratory tract following nasal and oral inhalation. The bioavailability of ribavirin administered via nasal and oral inhalation has not been determined but may depend on the method of drug delivery during nebulization (eg, oxygen hood, face mask, oxygen tent). At a constant flow rate, the amount of drug delivered to the respiratory tract theoretically is directly related to the concentration of nebulized drug solution and the duration of inhalation therapy. In addition, alterations in the method of aerosol delivery can affect the amount of drug reaching the respiratory tract. The fraction of an inhaled dose of ribavirin that is deposited in the respiratory tract during oral and nasal inhalation of a nebulized solution containing 190 ug/L using a small particle aerosol generator has been estimated to average about 70%, but the actual amount deposited depends on several factors including respiratory rate and tidal volume.', 'Peak plasma ribavirin concentrations generally appear to occur at the end of the inhalation period when the drug is inhaled orally and nasally using a small particle aerosol generator, and increase with increasing duration of the inhalation period. Following nasal and oral inhalation (via face mask) of 0.82 mg/kg/hr for 2.5 hr daily for 3 days in a limited number of pediatric patients, peak plasma ribavirin concentrations averaged 0.19 (range: 0.11-0.388) ug/mL. Peak plasma ribavirin concentrations averaged 0.275 (range: 0.21-0.35) or 1.1 (range: 0.45-2.18) ug/mL in a limited number of patients inhaling 0.82 mg/kg per hour for 5 or 8 hr daily, respectively, for 3 days, and averaged 1.7 (range: 0.38-3.58) ug/mL in a limited number of pediatric patients inhaling 0.82 mg/kg per hour via face mask, mist tent, or respirator for 20 hr daily for 5 days. Highest plasma concentrations for a given dosage of ribavirin appear to be achieved in patients receiving the drug from the aerosol generator via an endotracheal tube. ... Peak plasma ribavirin concentrations achieved with nasal and oral inhalation of usual dosages of the drug are less than concentrations that reportedly reduce respiratory syncytial virus plaque formation by 85-98%.', 'Concentrations of ribavirin achieved in respiratory tract secretions in patients inhaling the drug nasally and orally are likely to be substantially greater than those achieved in plasma. In a limited number of pediatric patients who received a nasally and orally inhaled ribavirin dose of 0.82 mg/kg per hour for 8 hr daily for 3 days, peak concentrations of the drug in respiratory tract secretions (from endotracheal tube) ranged from 250-1925 ug/mL. In pediatric patients who received 0.82 mg/kg per hour via nasal and oral inhalation for 20 hr daily for 5 days, ribavirin concentrations in respiratory tract secretions (from endotracheal tube) ranged from 313-28,250 ug/mL during therapy, with peak concentrations averaging 3075 (range: 313-7050) ug/mL at the end of therapy. Concentrations of ribavirin achieved in respiratory tract secretions via nasal and oral inhalation are likely to be substantially greater than concentrations necessary to inhibit plaque formation of susceptible strains of respiratory syncytial virus in vitro; however, because respiratory syncytial virus is found within virus infected cells in the respiratory tract, the manufacturer states that intracellular respiratory tract drug concentrations may be more closely related to plasma ribavirin concentrations than to those measured in respiratory tract secretions.', 'Ribavirin is rapidly absorbed following oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations of the drug occurring within 1-3 hr after multiple doses. However, the absolute bioavailability of ribavirin averages only 64% following oral administration because the drug undergoes first-pass metabolism.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for RIBAVIRIN (10 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['First and as a step required for activation, ribavirin is phosphorylated intracellularly by adenosine kinase to ribavirin mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. After activation and function, ribavirin undergoes two metabolic pathways where it is reversibly phosphorlyated or degraded via deribosylation and amide hydrolysis to yield a triazole carboxylic acid metabolite. In vitro studies indicate that ribavirin is not a substrate of CYP450 enzymes.', ""Ribavirin is metabolized principally to deribosylated ribavirin (the 1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide), probably in the liver; the antiviral activity of 1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide against various RNA and DNA viruses is reportedly similar to ribavirin. The drug is also metabolized to 1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxylic acid. In vitro, ribavirin has been shown to be metabolized to ribavirin-5'-monophosphate, -diphosphate, and -triphosphate, principally by intracellular phosphorylation of the drug via adenosine kinase and other cellular enzymes. It is likely that phosphorylation in vivo is necessary for the antiviral activity of the drug. Ribavirin also undergoes phosphorylation in erythrocytes, principally to ribavirin-5'-triphosphate; approximately 81, 16, and 3% of drug metabolized in erythrocytes is present as ribavirin-5'-triphosphate, -diphosphate, and -monophosphate, respectively. It has been suggested that prolonged distribution of the drug in erythrocytes may result from minimal phosphatase activity in these cells with transit of the drug out of cells dependent on dephosphorylation via phosphatases."", 'Ribavirin has two pathways of metabolism: (i) a reversible phosphorylation pathway in nucleated cells; and (ii) a degradative pathway involving deribosylation and amide hydrolysis to yield a triazole carboxylic acid metabolite. Ribavirin and its triazole carboxamide and triazole carboxylic acid metabolites are excreted renally.']","['The terminal half-life of ribavirin following administration of a single oral dose of 1200 mg is about 120 to 170 hours.', 'Distribution: Intravenous: Approximately 0.2 hours.

Clinical studies have shown amikacin sulfate injection to be effective in bacterial septicemia (including neonatal sepsis); in serious infections of the respiratory tract, bones and joints, central nervous system (including meningitis) and skin and soft tissue; intra-abdominal infections (including peritonitis); and in burns and postoperative infections (including post-vascular surgery).  Clinical studies have shown amikacin also to be effective in serious, complicated, and recurrent urinary tract infections due to the above organisms. Aminoglycosides, including amikacin, are not indicated in uncomplicated first-time episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics which are less toxic.  In September 2018, a new indication with a new dosage route was approved for this drug. Amikacin liposome inhalation suspension was approved for the treatment of lung disease caused by a group of bacteria, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in a limited population of patients with the disease who do not respond to conventional treatment (refractory disease). This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on achieving sputum culture conversion (defined as 3 consecutive negative monthly sputum cultures) by Month 6 of treatment. Clinical benefit has not yet been established.  **Important notes regarding Staphylococcus and Sensitivity testing:**  Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, is the principal Gram-positive organism sensitive to amikacin. The use of amikacin in the treatment of staphylococcal infections should be restricted only to second-line therapy, and should be limited to only those patients suffering from severe infections caused by susceptible strains of staphylococcus species who have failed to show sensitivity to other available antibiotics.  Bacteriologic studies should be performed to identify causative organisms and their susceptibilities to amikacin. Amikacin may be used as initial therapy in suspected gram-negative infections and therapy may be initiated before obtaining the results of susceptibility testing.']","['Amikacin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. Aminoglycosides bind to the bacteria, causing misreading of t-RNA, leaving bacteria unable to synthesize proteins vital to their growth. Aminoglycosides are useful mainly in the treatment infections involving aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter. In addition, some mycobacteria, including the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, are susceptible to aminoglycosides.

In addition, another group of four rats were given a single oral gavage dose of 200 mg/kg of ((14)C)FF-680 in corn oil and were used for bile collection. At all dose levels, (14)CFF-680-derived radioactivity was excreted almost totally via the fecal route (> 99% of the total excreted (14)C), with < 1% recovered in the urine. No radioactivity was detected in the expired air, and very little radioactivity was excreted in the bile (ca. 0.04% of the dose). At 4 days after the start of administration of the dosed diet for 1 day, no radioactivity was detected in any tissue analyzed, except adipose tissue, skin, and thymus, in which trace concentrations of radioactivity were detected in some animals. At 10 days after the start of administration of dosed diet to rats dosed for 10 days, trace but detectable levels of radioactivity were observed in all tissues analyzed except the brain of some animals. Excluding the gastrointestinal tract, adipose tissue contained the highest concentration of (14)C radioactivity, followed by kidney, skin, and thymus, whereas brain, testes, and spleen contained the lowest concentrations of radioactivity. No parent compound was detected in the urine, while fecal radioactivity was identified as the parent compound. Mean recovery of radioactivity ranged from ca. 86-101% of the ((14)C) FF-680 consumed. The data indicate that FF-680 was very poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

BTBPE was fairly insoluble in lipophilic solutions, which made dose preparation difficult. The great majority of (14)C (>94%) was excreted in the feces of both groups of rats at 72 hr, and tissue retention was minimal.

Metabolites were excreted in the urine, bile and feces, but at a very low level. ... Despite a limited quantity of stable metabolites extractable in the feces, non-extractable (14)C levels were relatively high (39% of the 0-24 hr fecal (14)C), which suggested that BTBPE could be metabolically activated in the rat and covalently bound to fecal proteins and/or lipids.

For PCB-contaminated soil, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency uses a dermal absorption factor of 14%, based on a 1993 study of dermal absorption in rhesus monkeys.  /This/ study examined several parameters that can influence the dermal absorption of lipophilic hydrocarbons, including soil organic content, particle size, skin residence time, and contaminant ""aging"" in the soil. Four groups of four female rhesus monkeys each were exposed to radiolabeled Aroclor 1260 either intravenously (100% absorption) or dermally with PCB-spiked soil. Groups exposed for 12 or 24 hr to PCBs aged in soil exhibited percutaneous absorption values of 3.43 +/- 0.35 and 4.26 +/- 0.52%, respectively, while a group exposed for 24 hr to soil freshly spiked with PCBs exhibited a dermal absorption value of 4.07 +/- 0.46%. Evidence strongly suggests that the factor most responsible for modulating the percutaneous absorption of highly lipophilic compounds from soil is its organic content. The base soil used in /this/ study with Aroclor 1260 had an organic content of 5-6% (< or =2 mm particle fraction), a value typical for U.S. soil. The organic content of the soil applied to the skin was 8.7% (< 150 um particle fraction), a value that contrasts sharply with the soil containing 0.9% organics used in the 1993 study with Aroclors 1242 and 1254 that produced a dermal absorption value of 14% for PCBs.', 'Pigeons were injected with a single dose of commercial PCB mixtures (Aroclor 1248 plus Aroclor 1260), killed 120 hr later and the abundance of individual PCBs was determined in adipose tissue, gonads, liver, brain, kidney, heart, muscle and blood. Elimination factors for individual PCBs were calculated. Values of greater than 1 were obtained for PCBs with meta-para-unsubstituted carbon atoms in at least one ring, indicating that elimination exceeded accumulation in all or most tissues. By contrast, ortho-meta unsubstituted PCBs had elimination factors less than 1, thus indicating their impaired removal. Tissues with high microsomal monooxygenase activity had the highest elimination factors for individual PCBs (ie, liver greater than kidney greater than muscle greater than heart). Distribution of individual PCBs was independent of sex and of ortho-chlorine substitution and showed that 90% of total PCBs in cadavers was present in adipose tissue, 2% in kidneys, 1% each in brain, muscle and heart and less than 0.1% in blood. The distribution of the highly toxic non-ortho and mono-ortho substituted PCBs did not differ among all tissues analyzed ... Elimination of PCBs in vivo is favored by the molecular feature of unsubstituted meta-para carbon atoms in the biphenyl moiety. /Aroclor 1248 plus Aroclor 1260 mixture/', 'The use of serum reference materials for assessing exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was described. Adult female goats were fed 100 (mg/kg) Aroclor-1016, Aroclor-1242, Aroclor-1254, or Aroclor-1260 alone or in combination. The combined doses totalled 200 mg/kg. Thirty days later, the goats were killed, and sera were obtained and analyzed by gas chromatography. Sera from three human cases of suspected PCB exposure were also analyzed. Two of these cases were composite samples of populations allegedly exposed to Aroclor-1260. The samples contained 307 and 31 parts per billion (ppb), reported as Aroclor-1260. The third case contained 172 ppb, alleged to be Aroclor-1254. The chromatographic data was subjected to principal components and Jaccard coefficient analysis in an effort to relate the human sera samples to the sera of the goats. The human sera from the suspected Aroclor-1254 exposure resembled that of Aroclor-1254 in the goat sera. Neither case of alleged Aroclor-1260 exposure resembled that of Aroclor-1260. Principal components analysis of one of the suspected Aroclor-1260 cases showed that the sera resembled that of Aroclor-1216 and Aroclor-1242 in the goat sera. ... Using in vivo reference materials may prove useful in delineating PCB exposures in people living near hazardous waste sites.', 'A number of animal studies have demonstrated that PCB mixtures and specific congeners and isomers can cross the placental barrier and enter the fetus. High levels of lipid soluble PCBs accumulate in the fat portion of the milk, also resulting in high exposure of suckling animals. Significantly increased PCB residues were detected in blastocytes (day 6 postcoitum) from female rabbits administered Aroclor 1260 before insemination, but no residues could be detected in cleavage stage embryos (day 1 postcoitum). In pregnant mice fed PCBs through the first 18 days of gestation, the highest levels of serum PCBs were found in 1-2-week-old offspring compared with 18-day fetuses or with older offspring. In studies that exposed monkeys prior to and during gestation, signs of PCB-induced intoxication were observed in suckling offspring, but not in neonates. PCB blood levels in the offspring continuously increased during lactation, but decreased just before or immediately upon weaning. In rats administered PCBs before gestation, 0.003% of the PCBs accumulated in the dams was transferred to the fetus through the placenta; however, the amount transferred to sucklings increased to 5% of the maternal PCB. Similar results have been reported in ferrets administered single doses of PCBs early or late during gestation. Results such as these have led to the conclusion that suckling may account for higher exposure of young offspring than does placental transfer; the fetus, however, may be more sensitive.', '...

Evidently, some people continue to be exposed to PCBs or the half-life of the less chlorinated congeners is longer than previously thought.']"

By 5 days, 90% had been eliminated. The monkey eliminated less than 15% of the dose within 24 hr, with less than 1% in the feces. The remainder was found in the adipose tissue. Within 28 days, 59% of the dose had been eliminated, chiefly in the urine. Biliary excretion after 24 hr was shown to be 33% in the dog and only 0.4% in the monkey. The data for 2,4,5,2',4',5' hexachlorobiphenyl showed that the dog eliminated 66% (urine, 3%; feces, 63%) within 3 days; the monkey eliminated 18 % of the dose (of which 17% was in the feces), 90 days following administration. The remainder was found in the adipose tissue. In the studies with 2,3,6,2',3',6' hexachlorobiphenyl, the dog eliminated 52% of the dose within 24 hr (urine, 11%; feces, 41%) and 70% in 3 days. The monkey eliminated 19% during the first 24 hr, divided equally between urine and feces. By 15 days, 61% had been eliminated, primarily in the feces. The 24 hr biliary excretion was 26% and 2.4% in the dog and the monkey, respectively."", 'Rats /were/ fed 100 ppm of Aroclor 1016 (6.6-3.5 mg/kg/day). Plasma, kidneys, urine, brain, liver, and adipose tissue were analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10 mo of exposure. PCB tissue levels were determined 2, 4, 5, and 6 mo after exposure was discontinued. Levels of PCBs were highest in adipose tissue where a steady state was approached in 2 and reached in 4 mo. Little PCB-residue was excreted in urine. Measureable residues were still present after 5 mo.', 'Toxicity of Aroclor 1016 to different age groups of sheepshead minnows was studied in intermittent-flow bioassays lasting 26 days. 32 and 100 ug/L killed newly hatched fry, juveniles, and adults. Sheepshead minnows accumulated the chemical in proportion to its concentration in test water. Fry contained 2500-8100 times the concentration added to the test water, adults 1700-15000 times, and juveniles 10000-34000 times. As much as 77 ug/L of Aroclor 1016 in eggs from exposed adults apparently did not affect survival of embryos or fry.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for Aroclor 1016 (7 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","[""The metabolism of PCBs following oral and parenteral administration in animals has been extensively studied and reviewed, but studies in animals following inhalation or dermal exposure are lacking. Information on metabolism of PCBs in humans is limited to occupationally exposed individuals whose intake is derived mainly from inhalation and dermal exposure. In general, metabolism of PCBs depends on the number and position of the chlorine atoms on the phenyl rings of the constituent congeners (i.e., congener profile of the PCB mixture) and animal species. Although only limited data are available on metabolism of PCBs following inhalation exposure, there is no reason to suspect that PCBs are metabolized differently by this route.  Data exist on the in vitro hepatic metabolism and in vivo metabolic clearance of 2,2',3,3',6,6'-hexachlorobiphenyl and 4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl congeners in humans, monkeys, dogs, and rats. Both of these congeners are present in Aroclor 1016, but the hexachlorobiphenyl is only a minor constituent. For each congener, the Vmax values for metabolism in the monkey, dog and rat are consistent with the respective metabolic clearance values found in vivo. Thus, the kinetic constants for PCB metabolism obtained from the dog, monkey, and rat hepatic microsomal preparations were good predictors of in vivo metabolism and clearance for these congeners. In investigations directed at determining which species most accurately predicts the metabolism and disposition of PCBs in humans, the in vitro metabolism of these congeners was also studied using human liver microsomes. Available data suggest that metabolism of PCBs in humans most closely resembles that of the monkey and rat. For example, the in vitro apparent Km and Vmax for humans and monkeys are comparable. These studies show consistency between the in vitro and in vivo findings and collectively indicate that metabolism of the two congeners is similar in monkeys and humans.""]",

It is excreted unchanged in the urine, although there is evidence of biliary excretion and enterohepatic circulation.', 'The percutaneous absorption of (14)C-labelled glyphosate from 3 formulations of glyphosate was measured in excised human abdominal skin using an in vitro technique. Glyphosate was found to be very poorly absorbed under these conditions, with the epidermis acting as the primary barrier /Glyphosate formulations/.', 'The percutaneous absorption of glyphosate was studied in vivo and in vitro. The ability of Roundup, a commercial glyphosate formulation, applied neat and in 1:20 to 1:32 dilutions to penetrate human thigh skin samples obtained at autopsy was evaluated using flow through cells containing human plasma as the receptor fluid. The ability of 14C-labeled Roundup and the 1:20 and 1:32 dilutions to bind to powdered human stratum corneum was investigated. Adult female rhesus monkeys were administered 500 or 5400 ug per 200 sq cm labeled glyphosate topically or 9 or 93 ug glyphosate iv. Blood and urine samples were collected starting 24 hr before dosing and up to 8 days post dosing and assayed for carbon-14 activity. Selected monkeys were killed 7 days after topical exposure to determine the tissue distribution of glyphosate derived carbon-14 activity. Other monkeys were topically administered a 1:20 dilution of 14C-labeled glyphosate.The application sites were washed with soap and water or water 0 to 24 hr later to assess the ability of these treatments to remove glyphosate. In vitro, less than 2% of the applied glyphosate penetrated human skin. Glyphosate as Roundup or in diluted form did not bind to powdered stratum corneum. Around 95 to 99% of iv administered glyphosate was excreted in the urine, mostly within the first 24 hr. Following topical application only 2.2% of the 5400 ug/200 sq cm dose and 0.8% of the 500 ug/200 sq cm dose were excreted in the urine over 8 days. Based on the iv data, 0.8 to 2.2% of the applied doses was estimated to have been absorbed. Glyphosate was detected in the blood after iv administration, but not topical application. No glyphosate derived radioactivity was detected in any internal organs after topical application. Soap and water, or water removed 89.6 and 83.6% of the applied dose, respectively, 12 hr after treatment. Both treatments removed about 50% of the applied dose 24 hr after exposure. It was concluded that the amounts of glyphosate absorbed through the skin of rhesus monkeys is low, on the order of 0.8 to 2.2%. Since the rhesus monkey is a good model for percutaneous absorption relevant to humans, glyphosate should have little dermal toxicity for humans. /Roundup/', 'Interactions /of glyphosate/ with skin and potential systemic availability through percutaneous absorption was studied by skin binding, skin absorption, residual tissue distribution, and skin decontamination. Glyphosate in a final formulation (Roundup) undiluted and diluted with water 1:20 and 1:32, would not partition into powdered human stratum corneum (<1%). In vitro percutaneous absorption through human skin into human plasma as receptor fluid was no more than 2% over a concentration range of 0.5-154 ug/sq cm and a topical volume range of 0.014-0.14 mL/sq cm. Disposition of glyphosate following iv administration of 93 and 9 ug doses to rhesus monkeys was mainly through urine excretion, 95 + or - 8 and 99 + or - 4% in 7 days, respectively. Percutaneous absorption in vivo in rhesus monkey was 0.8 + or - 0.6% for the low dose (25 ug/sq cm) and 2.2 + or - 0.8% for the high dose (270 ug/sq cm). No residual (14)C was found in organs of the monkeys euthanized 7 days after the topical application. Washing the skin application site with soap and water removed 90 + or - 4% of applied dose, and washing with water only removed 84 + or - 3% of applied dose. Both soap and water and water only were equal in ability to remove glyphosate from skin over a 24 hr skin application period. About 50% of the initially applied dose could be recovered after 24 hr. Glyphosate is very soluble in water and insoluble in most organics (octanol/water log P = -1.70) and therefore not compatible with the lipid-laden stratum corneum. This is consistent with the low skin binding and skin absorption and also consistent with the efficient removal from skin with soap and water or water-only wash. /Roundup/', 'In lactating goats concentrations of carbon-14 label in milk were measured after giving capsules containing a 9:1 mixture of (14)C-glyphosate and (14)C-aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) to a dose level equivalent to 120 mg/kg diet (expressed as free acid) for 5 days.

Royal Hart Wistar rats were administered a single oral dose of radiolabeled methyl labeled or ethyl labeled pendimethalin.

After 96 hr, the residues were less than 0.3 ppm in all tissues except fat, which had a residue of 0.9 ppm. The major metabolic routes of pendimethalin involved hydroxylation of the 4-methyl and the N-1-ethyl group, oxidation of these alkyl groups to carboxylic acids, nitro reduction, cyclization, and conjugation based on the identification of the 12 metabolites in urine and tissues. Products of cyclization reactions giving rise to methylbenzimidazole carboxylic acids were unique to liver and kidney. All major metabolites retained both radioactive labels of pendimethalin, indicating that N-dealkylation of the isopentyl group was not significant. This investigation extends the knowledge on the fate of dinitroanilines in the rat and demonstrates that pendimethalin is metabolized by several major pathways.']",

If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled. Guanadrel works by controlling nerve impulses along certain nerve pathways. As a result, it relaxes the blood vessels so that blood passes through them more easily. This helps to lower blood pressure.']","['Drugs used in the treatment of acute or chronic vascular HYPERTENSION regardless of pharmacological mechanism.

Stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors leads to decreased peripheral sympathetic tone and reduced arterial pressure. Methyldopa causes a net reduction in the tissue concentration of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Overall, methyldopa lowers both standing blood pressure and especially supine blood pressure, with infrequent symptomatic postural hypotension. Methyldopa also reduces plasma renin activity but has negligible effects on glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, or filtration fraction. It also has no direct effect on cardiac function but in some patients, a slowed heart rate may occur.  Following oral administration, blood-pressure-lowering effects are observed within 12 to 24 hours in most patients, and a maximum reduction in blood pressure occurs in 4 to 6 hours. Blood pressure returns to pre-treatment levels within 24 to 48 hours following drug discontinuation.

Also for the treatment of secondary hyperlipidaemias, e.g. severe hypertriglyceridemias, when sufficient improvement does not occur after correction of the underlying disorder (e.g. diabetes mellitus).']","['Bezafibrate is an antilipemic agent that lowers cholesterol and triglycerides. It decreases low density lipoproteins and increases high density lipoproteins. Bezafibrate lowers elevated blood lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol). Elevated VLDL and LDL are reduced by treatment with bezafibrate, whilst HDL-levels are increased. The activity of triglyceride lipases (lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipoproteinlipase) involved in the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is increased by bezafibrate. In the course of the intensified degradation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons, VLDL) precursors for the formation of HDL are formed which explains an increase in HDL. Furthermore, cholesterol biosynthesis is reduced by bezafibrate, which is accompanied by a stimulation of the LDL-receptor-mediated lipoprotein catabolism. Elevated fibrinogen appears to be an important risk-factor, alongside the lipids, smoking and hypertension, in the development of atheroma. Fibrinogen plays an important role in viscosity, and therefore blood flow, and also appears to play an important role in thrombus development and lysability. Bezafibrate exerts an effect on thrombogenic factors. A significant decrease in elevated plasma fibrinogen levels can be achieved. This may lead, amongst other things, to a reduction in both blood and plasma viscosity. Inhibition of platelet aggregation has also been observed. A reduction in blood glucose concentration due to an increase in glucose tolerance has been reported in diabetic patients. In the same patients, the concentration of fasting and postprandial free fatty acids was reduced by bezafibrate.']",['Substances that lower the levels of certain LIPIDS in the BLOOD.

Transferase activities were measured toward the acetyl acceptors sulfamethazine and p-aminobenzoic acid in partially purified preparation of cytosols. Cell lines such as hamster V79, BHK, rat hepatoma H4IIEC3G- or fibroblast 208F, which are sensitive to 1,6-dinitropyrene (1,6-DNP), possess high transferase activities ranging from 120-270 nmol/min x mg protein.

There was no apparent correlation between 1,6-DNP sensitivity and acetyltransferase levels in a few cell lines, e.g. rat hepatoma HTC, 2sFou and 5L, which express intermediate transferase activities ranging from 25-50 nmol/min x mg protein.

Further reduction of nitrosopyrenes is required for their activation to a DNA-reactive N-hydroxylamines. In this work, 1-nitro-3-nitrosopyrene was synthesized and the electrochemical and enzyme-catalyzed reduction of 1-nitro-3-nitrosopyrene has been compared with that of 1-nitro-6-nitrosopyrene. As determined by cyclic voltammetry, the reduction potentials of 1-nitro-3-nitrosopyrene, 1-nitro-6-nitrosopyrene and their parent dinitropyrenes were similar, although 1-nitro-3-nitrosopyrene did have a slightly more negative cathodic peak potential than the other three compounds. The NADPH-mediated reduction of 1-nitro-6-nitrosopyrene to intermediates which reduce succinoylated cytochrome c was faster than that of 1-nitro-3-nitrosopyrene. In the presence of rat liver microsomes or cytosol, the reduction of 1-nitro-6-nitrosopyrene was faster than that of 1-nitro-3-nitrosopyrene. These differences in the rates of nitro-nitrosopyrene reduction may be one factor contributing to the lower tumorigenic potential of 1,3-dinitropyrene relative to 1,6-dinitropyrene.', '1-Nitro-6-nitrosopyrene, 1-amino-6-nitropyrene and 1,6-diaminopyrene were detected as metabolites in rat mammary gland cytosol incubated with 1,6-dinitropyrene under anaerobic conditions.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for 1,6-Dinitropyrene (8 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']",

The same C8-substituted deoxyguanosine adducts were formed that were found in the xanthine oxidase-catalyzed reactions, which confirmed that incubation with this nitroreductase generated reactive N-hydroxy arylamine intermediates. In incubations with rat and human liver microsomes and cytosol, 1-nitropyrene and 1,3-dinitropyrene were reduced to a lesser extent than 1,6- and 1,8-dinitropyrene, which was in accord with their relative mutagenicities. Each of the cytosolic incubations were similar in that oxygen decreased aminopyrene, but not nitrosopyrene, formation. The data indicated that reduced derivatives of the nitrosopyrenes were redox cycling with oxygen, which decreased cytosolic aminopyrene formation. In cytosolic incubations, oxygen inhibited the reduction of 1-nitropyrene and 1,3-dinitropyrene to a greater extent than 1,6- and 1,8-dinitropyrene. By comparison, in microsomal investigations, the nitroreduction of each nitrated pyrene was equally oxygen-sensitive. This apparently was caused by the initial nitroanion radicals reacting with oxygen to decrease nitrosopyrene formation. Although more extensive nitroreduction of each compound was detected in anaerobic incubations, aerobic reduction of these compounds did occur and may be important during in vivo exposure to nitrated pyrenes. When rat liver cytosol was incubated with the nitrated pyrenes, very low levels of DNA binding were detected. Addition of acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) to these incubations increased the binding of the dinitropyrenes 20- to 40-fold, while the binding of 1-nitropyrene was not affected. The extent of AcCoA-dependent binding of the dinitropyrenes reflected the amount of nitroreduction; however, the increase in binding did not occur with dog liver cytosol, which was known to be deficient in N-acetylases. These results indicated that cytosolic nitroreductases catalyzed the formation of N-hydroxy arylamine intermediates, which in the case of dinitropyrenes were converted to reactive N-acetoxy arylamines by cytosolic AcCoA-dependent acetylases.', '... The ability of rabbit lung to metabolize 1,8-dinitro(4,5,9,10-3H)pyrene by both oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent pathways has been investigated. Using lung 9000 g supernatant, the biotransformation of 1,8-dinitropyrene to stable metabolites was more extensive in the absence of oxygen. A major proportion of the metabolites was ether-extractable. Five metabolite peaks (A-E) were detected by HPLC in the absence of oxygen. Formation of metabolites A, C, D and E was decreased under aerobic conditions. Metabolites B and C co-chromatographed with the reference standards 1,8-diaminopyrene and 1-acetyl-amino-8-nitropyrene, respectively. The formation of metabolites A and C was dependent on the presence of acetyl coenzyme A. Binding of radiolabel to calf thymus DNA occurred under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions, although there was significantly higher binding in the presence of oxygen. Omission of acetyl coenzyme A significantly increased DNA binding. In experiments where calf thymus DNA was omitted from the incubation medium, covalent binding of radiolabel to acid-precipitable lung S9 macromolecules was detected only under aerobic conditions (11.1 +/- 4.3 pmol/mg protein). The results indicate that rabbit lung can metabolize 1,8-dinitropyrene  by both reductive and oxidative pathways. Reductive metabolism is the major pathway for formation of stable metabolites while alkylation of cellular macromolecules occurs primarily via oxidation. There was no correlation between acetyl coenzyme A-dependent acetylation and activation of 1,8-dinitropyrene to reactive species which bind to DNA.', 'The metabolic activation of dinitropyrenes occurs by reduction of one nitro group to yield N-hydroxy-1-amino-x-nitropyrene, where x is 3, 6 or 8, depending on the original compound. These N-hydroxyarylamine intermediates can undergo acid-catalyzed DNA binding or, in contrast to 1-nitropyrene, which is only N-acetylated, can be converted into highly reactive O-acetyl metabolites by bacterial and mammalian transacetylases. This activation pathway has been shown to be responsible for their extreme mutagenicity in Salmonella. In rat liver cytosolic incubations, 1-nitropyrene and 1,3-dinitropyrene were reduced to a much lesser extent than 1,6- or 1,8-dinitropyrene, which suggests that there may be fundamental differences in the reduction pathways between these nitroPAHs. /Dinitropyrenes/', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for 1,8-Dinitropyrene (10 total), please visit the HSDB record page.', '1,8-dinitropyrene has known human metabolites that include 1-amino-8-nitropyrene.']",

This is related to the long-term therapeutic effects, as lowering the blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. Diltiazem inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium ions across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes during depolarization. Diltiazem is classified as a negative inotrope (decreased force) and negative chronotrope (decreased rate). It is also considered a rate-control drug as it reduces heart rate. Diltiazem is exerts hemodynamic actions by reducing blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, the rate-pressure product, and coronary vascular resistance while increasing coronary blood flow. Diltiazem decreases sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction in isolated tissues and has a negative inotropic effect in isolated preparations. In supraventricular tachycardia, diltiazem prolongs AV nodal refractories.  As the magnitude of blood pressure reduction is related to the degree of hypertension, the antihypertensive effect of diltiazem is most pronounced in individuals with hypertension. In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-response study involving patients with essential hypertension, there was a reduction in the diastolic blood pressure by 1.9, 5.4, 6.1, and 8.6 mmHg in the patients receiving diltiazem at doses of 120, 240, 360, and 540 mg, respectively. In patients receiving placebo, there was a reduction in the diastolic blood pressure by 2.6 mmHg.In a randomized, double-blind study involving patients with chronic stable angina, variable doses of diltiazem administered at night all caused an increased exercise tolerance in the after 21 hours, compared to placebo. In the NORDIL study of patients with hypertension, the therapeutic effectiveness of diltiazem in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was assessed. When using the combined primary endpoint as fatal and non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular death, fatal and non-fatal stroke was shown to be reduced by 25% in the diltiazem group. Although the clinical significance to this effect remains unclear, it is suggested that diltiazem may exert a protective role against cerebral stroke in hypertensive patients.']","['Agents that affect the rate or intensity of cardiac contraction, blood vessel diameter, or blood volume.

Triadimefon was applied (41.1 to 46.4 ug/sq cm) in 0.2 mL of acetone to areas comprising 3% of the body surface (7.0 to 14.5 sq cm). Thirty six animals were treated at the initiation of each study.Groups of 3 animals were subsequently killed at 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, and 192 hr after treatment. Skin from the treated area as well as blood, heart, liver, kidneys, remaining carcass, urine, and feces were analyzed for (14)C by scintillation counting techniques. Based on 14 counts, triadimefon was lost more rapidly from the skin of young animals (half-life, 20 to 25 hr) than from the skin of adult animals (half-life, 29 to 53 hr). Recovery studies indicated that adult males, adult females, young males, and young females, respectively, absorbed 53, 82, 57, and 52% of the dose. The rest of the dose based on material balance was presumably lost by evaporation. Approx 2.5 to 3.9% of the dose penetrated the skin in 1 hr and was available for absorption. The rate of entry triadimefon into blood was 2 to 2.5 times faster for young than that observed in adult animals. Elimination of it from blood was faster in the case of the young animals.

Substrate depletion methods were used due to the complex array of metabolites produced from myclobutanil and triadimefon. Myclobutanil was metabolized more rapidly than triadimefon, which is consistent with metabolism of the n-butyl side-chain in the former and the t-butyl group in the latter compound. Human and rat CYP2C and CYP3A enzymes were the most active. Metabolism was similar in microsomes prepared from livers of control and low-dose rats. High-dose (115 mg/kg/day of triadimefon or 150 mg/kg/day of myclobutanil) rats showed increased liver weight, induction of total CYP, and increased metabolism of the two triazoles, though the apparent Km appeared unchanged relative to the control.

In general, urine accounted for most of the label recovered. Feces generally contained about half as much label as urine for a given group. Most of the label was removed in the washing step in all groups, but the highest percentage recovery in washing was obtained from the higher dose animals.']","[""The mechanism of antiandrogenic activity of vinclozolin was investigated using recombinant human androgen receptor (AR). The two primary metabolites of vinclozolin in plants and mammals are M1 (2-[[3,5-dichlorophenyl)-carbamoyl]oxy]-2-methyl-3-butenoic acid) and M2 (3',5'-dichloro-2-hydroxy-2-methylbut-3-enanilide). Both metabolites, in a dose-dependent manner, target androgen receptor to the nucleus and inhibit androgen-induced transactivation mediated by the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. 3',5'-Dichloro-2-hydroxy-2-methylbut-3-enanilide is a 50-fold more potent inhibitor than (2-[[3,5-dichlorophenyl)-carbamoyl]oxy]-2-methyl-3-butenoic acid) and only 2-fold less than hydroxyflutamide. In the presence of dihydrotestosterone (50 nM), 3',5'-dichloro-2-hydroxy-2-methylbut-3-enanilide (0.2-10 uM) inhibits androgen-induced androgen receptor binding to androgen response element DNA. In the absence of dihydrotestosterone, concentrations of 10 uM 3',5'-dichloro-2-hydroxy-2-methylbut-3-enanilide or hydroxyflutamide promote androgen receptor binding to androgen response element DNA and activation of transcription. Agonist activities of 3',5'-dichloro-2-hydroxy-2-methylbut-3-enanilide and hydroxyflutamide occur at 10-fold lower concentrations with the mutant androgen receptor (Thr877 to Ala) endogenous to LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. The results indicate that androgen antagonists can act as agonists, depending on ligand binding affinity, concentration, and the presence of competing natural ligands."", ""Vinclozolin (V) is a fungicide used in agricultural settings.

V, M1 and M2 have antiandrogenic properties by interacting with the androgen receptor ... Our objective was to characterize V metabolism by rat liver microsomes. V was incubated with non-treated adult male Long-Evans rat liver microsomes and NADPH. Several metabolites were detected following the extraction of incubate with acetonitrile and analysis by HPLC/DAD/MSD. One metabolite was identified as [3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-5-methyl-5-(1,2-dihydroxyethyl)-1,3-oxazolidine-2,4-dione] (M4), which was gradually converted to 3',5'-dichloro-2,3,4-trihydroxy-2-methylbutylanilide (M5).

Pretreatment of the (inner ear skin) exposure site with barrier cream eliminated mortality, reduced cholinesterase inhibition and prevented any physiological or biochemical signs of intoxication. In contrast, untreated animals exposed to VX exhibited severe signs of intoxication, near total AChE inhibition and generally died within the (3 hr) exposure period (5/6 animals). Application of the barrier cream caused a significant decrease in the area of skin contaminated by VX. It was tentatively concluded that spreading was predominantly a surface phenomena (possibly mediated by capillary movement of the agent through the microrelief or between hair follicles) with little or no contribution from lateral diffusion within the stratum corneum. There was a disparity between the in vitro and in vivo skin absorption measurements that was ascribed to the absence of systemic clearance in vitro. However, both models indicated a substantial reservoir of VX within the skin ...', '... In order to obtain basic information on the toxicokinetics of (+/-)-VX, i.e., under conditions of 100% bioavailability, the blood levels of this agent were measured in hairless guinea pigs at iv doses corresponding with 1 and 2 x  LD50. The derived AUCs indicate a reasonable linearity of the toxicokinetics with dose. Also, the toxicokinetics in marmoset primates was studied at an absolute iv dose corresponding with 1 x  LD50 in the hairless guinea pig which led to approximately the same levels of (+/-)-VX in blood as observed at 2 x  LD50 in the hairless guinea pig. Finally, the toxicokinetics of (+/-)-VX were measured in hairless guinea pigs via the ...  percutaneous route at a dose corresponding with 1 x  LD50 (pc). Large variations were observed between individual animals in the rate of penetration of (+/-)-VX and in concomitant progression of AChE inhibition in blood of these animals. Blood levels of (+/-)-VX increased gradually over a 6-hr period of time. After a 7-hr penetration period, the total AUC corresponded with 2.5% bioavailability relative to iv administration. In contrast with the G-agents C(+/-)P(+/-)-soman and (+/-)-sarin, stereospecificity in the sequestration of the two enantiomers of (+/-)-VX is not a prominent phenomenon. It appears that (+/-)-VX is substantially more persistent in vivo than the two G-agents. This persistence may undermine the efficacy of pretreatment with carbamates of percutaneous intoxication in particular due to gradual replacement of carbamate on AChE by (+/-)-VX, whereas classical treatment of intoxication with oximes is hampered by the short persistence of oximes relative to the agent.', '... The purpose of the present study was to measure and compare the skin absorption kinetics of VX in vitro using pig, human and guinea pig skin to highlight any potential species differences in skin permeability. When undiluted VX was applied directly to the skin, the permeability of guinea pig skin was approximately 7-fold greater than human skin. There was no significant difference in the permeability of pig and human skin. When VX diluted with isopropyl alcohol was applied to the skin, the permeability of guinea pig skin was approximately 4-fold greater than human skin. There was no significant difference in the permeability of pig and human skin. From this data it may be inferred that dermatomed, abdominal pig skin is an appropriate model for the human skin absorption of VX.', 'Studies of the penetration of liquid VX through skin were conducted with Service volunteers in November 1960 ... . Drops of radioactively-tagged VX were placed on the skin in one of three locations: the back, the forearm, or the palm of the hand. The chosen area, excepting the palm, was shaved with an electric razor and a ring was attached to the skin. The rings used on the forearm and the palm were made of polythene with an internal diameter of 2.5 cm; those on the back were made of brass measuring 7 cm in diameter. VX was placed on the skin inside the ring in drops of 2 - 4 ug. Nylon film was stuck over the top of the ring. The assembly and VX were left in place for 6-10 hours, during which time a Geiger counter was used to take measurements. The assembly was then removed and the skin decontaminated, first by stripping with adhesive tape and then by washing with isopropanol and soapy water. ...  According to the volunteer records, 16 men took part in this study. ... ChE depressions observed were small, varying from 1.9% to 3.9%. After a brief delay the penetration of VX through the forearm and the back was ""regular and rapid"": on average, 8% of the VX dose penetrated through back skin and 15% through forearm skin in 8 hours.']",,

TCDF was completely absorbed. Within 3 days, <5% remained in liver or fat and <2% remained in skin, with no other tissues exhibiting significant amount of radioactivity. The liver was the main site of accumulation, with lesser amounts being present in adipose tissues and skin. It was excreted primarily by fecal route.

The four major metabolites considered to originate from TCDF were trichloromethoxy-dibenzofuran, two trichlorodimethoxy-dibenzofurans, and tetrachloromethoxydibenzofuran. The remaining nine metabolites, detected in minute amounts, originated most likely from contaminating PCDFs (1% triCDF, 8.4% tetraCDFs, 11.2% pentaCDFs).', 'Limited data suggest that autoinduction of metabolism and biliary excretion does occur for PCDFs, in contrast to PCDDs. Pretreatment of rats with 2,3,7,8-TCDF (1.0 umol/kg, 3 days earlier) significantly increased the biliary excretion of a subsequent dose of (14C)2,3,7,8-TCDF. The naive rats excreted 5.7 + or - 2.4% of the dose over the initial 8 hr, while the pretreated rats excreted 13.2 + or - 3.2% of the (14C)2,3,7,8-TCDF. Similarly, pretreatment of rats with 2,3,4,7,8-pentaCDF (500 ug/kg, /orally/, 3 days earlier) resulted in a two-fold increase in the biliary elimination of a subsequent dose of (14C)2,3,4,7,8-pentaCDF. These results suggest that pretreatment with 2,3,7,8-TCDF and 2,3,4,7,8-pentaCDF induces the metabolism of these congeners.', '...Isolated hepatocytes and liver slices in suspension culture and hepatic microsomes were used as in vitro models to assess the hepatic uptake and metabolism of [3H]- and [14C]TCDD and [3H]TCDF (0.01-1.0 uM) in control and induced (5 ug TCDD/kg, 3 days earlier) male Sprague-Dawley rats. TCDD pretreatment, with an increase in cytochromes P450 1A1 and 1A2 (CYP1A1, CYP1A2), produced an increase in the hepatic uptake of TCDD, while no increase in the hepatic uptake of TCDF was observed. ...The rates of metabolism of TCDD and TCDF were directly proportional to their concentrations. ...Very limited metabolism of TCDD and TCDF was observed in control rat liver (0.45 and 3.2 pmol/hr/g hepatocyte wet wt at 0.1 uM, respectively). TCDD induced its own rate of metabolism about two- to fivefold at 1.0 uM but no induction was observed at 0.01 and 0.1 uM. In contrast, TCDD markedly induced the rate of TCDF metabolism at all substrate concentrations.', '...Metabolism of all three compounds appears to be the rate-limiting step for excretion, which is primarily via the bile into the feces. Therefore, the biliary elimination of TCDF, TCDD, and TCB was examined as an indirect measure of metabolism. Male F344 rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital, the bile duct was cannulated, and 0.1 mumol [3H]TCDD, [14C]TCDF, or [14C]TCB/kg bw was administered iv. Bile was collected for 0-8 hr while the animals were kept under anesthesia. To determine if TCDF was able to induce its own metabolism in vivo, a single dose of 1.0 mumol TCDF/kg was administered to rats by oral gavage 3 days prior to iv injection of 0.1 or 0.3 mumol [14C]TCDF/kg. Biliary excretion and hepatic concentrations of [14C]TCDF were significantly increased in the pretreated animals. These results suggest an autoinduction of TCDF metabolism. Essentially all biliary [14C]TCDF radioactivity was attributable to metabolites. High-pressure liquid chromatography profiles of biliary radioactivity from 0-4 hr were qualitatively different between naive and pretreated rats. To determine if pretreatment with TCDD altered the metabolism of TCDF and vice versa, a single dose of 1.0 mumol TCDF/kg or 0.1 mumol TCDD/kg was administered by oral gavage 3 days prior to iv injection of 0.1 mumol [3H]TCDD or [14C]TCDF/kg, respectively.']","['In rhesus monkeys administered a single dose of 30.7 ug 14C-2,3,7,8-tetraCDF/kg iv the CDF was rapidly cleared from the blood.

Distribution of tissue concentration of radioactivity was studied by quantitative whole-body autoradiography. Pattern of radioactivity distribution across most tissues was similar for both corticosteroids after a single as well as after repeated dosing. However, tissue concentration of radioactivity differed between des-CIC and BUD. After a single dose, concentrations of radioactivity for both corticosteroids were low for most tissues but increased over 14 days of daily dosing. The tissue radioactivity of des-CIC at 24 hrs and 5 days after the 14th dose was 2-3 times higher than that of BUD in majority of tissues. Tissue accumulation, assessed as concentration of tissue radioactivity 5 days after the 14th versus 3rd dose, showed an average ratio of 5.2 for des-CIC and 2.7 for BUD (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, des-CIC accumulated significantly more than BUD.

Budesonide is excreted in urine and feces as metabolites.', 'Asthma is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world, for which the mainstay treatment has been inhaled glucocorticoids (GCs). Despite the widespread use of these drugs, approximately 30% of asthma sufferers exhibit some degree of steroid insensitivity or are refractory to inhaled GCs. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is interpatient variability in the clearance of these compounds. The objective of this research is to determine how metabolism of GCs by the CYP3A family of enzymes could affect their effectiveness in asthmatic patients. In this work, the metabolism of four frequently prescribed inhaled GCs, triamcinolone acetonide, flunisolide, budesonide, and fluticasone propionate, by the CYP3A family of enzymes was studied to identify differences in their rates of clearance and to identify their metabolites. Both interenzyme and interdrug variability in rates of metabolism and metabolic fate were observed. CYP3A4 was the most efficient metabolic catalyst for all the compounds, and CYP3A7 had the slowest rates. CYP3A5, which is particularly relevant to GC metabolism in the lungs, was also shown to efficiently metabolize triamcinolone acetonide, budesonide, and fluticasone propionate. In contrast, flunisolide was only metabolized via CYP3A4, with no significant turnover by CYP3A5 or CYP3A7. Common metabolites included 6 Beta-hydroxylation and Delta (6)-dehydrogenation for triamcinolone acetonide, budesonide, and flunisolide. The structure of Delta (6)-flunisolide was unambiguously established by NMR analysis. Metabolism also occurred on the D-ring substituents, including the 21-carboxy metabolites for triamcinolone acetonide and flunisolide. The novel metabolite 21-nortriamcinolone acetonide was also identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and NMR analysis.']",

A major concern is the possible hydrolysis of the D3G conjugate back to its toxic precursor mycotoxin DON during mammalian digestion. /The authors/ used in vitro model systems to investigate the stability of D3G to acidic conditions, hydrolytic enzymes and intestinal bacteria, mimicking different stages of digestion. D3G was found resistant to 0.2 M hydrochloric acid for at least 24 hr at 37 °C, suggesting that it will not be hydrolyzed in the stomach of mammals. While human cytosolic beta-glucosidase also had no effect, fungal cellulase and cellobiase preparations could cleave a significant portion of D3G. Most importantly, several lactic acid bacteria such as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus mundtii or Lactobacillus plantarum showed a high capability to hydrolyze D3G. Taken together these data indicate that D3G is of toxicological relevance and should be regarded as a masked mycotoxin.', 'Cultures of 20% w/w suspensions of rat cecal contents were incubated anaerobically with [(14)C]deoxynivalenol at a concentration of 35 ug/mL for up to 24 hr. A standard-co-elution method involving high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantify the proportions of radiolabel associated with deoxynivalenol and with the de-epoxidated form. The latter represented 1.3% of the administered radiolabel immediately after addition of deoxynivalenol, 29% at 7 hr, and 90% at 24 hr; 60% co-eluted with deoxynivalenol at 7 hr and 2% at 24 hr. ...Deoxynivalenol was not converted to the de-epoxy metabolite in cultures of the contents of pig large intestine (including caecum, but not otherwise specified) in another study in which 1 mL of a 1-ug/mL solution of deoxynivalenol was added to 2 g of large intestinal contents and incubated anaerobically for 96 hr. Nearly complete recovery of intact deoxynivalenol was reported. The intestinal contents of chickens treated identically showed nearly complete conversion of deoxynivalenol to the de-epoxy metabolite after 96 hr. After 24 hr of incubation, the rate of conversion was 56% of an applied concentration of 0.014 ug/mL, 69% of 0.14 ug/mL, and 70% of 1.4 ug/mL. Similarly, 35% of the applied deoxynivalenol was metabolized to the de-epoxy metabolite in bovine rumenal fluid after 96 hr of incubation.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for DEOXYNIVALENOL (8 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['/In pigs/ after oral intake, the peak concentration in plasma was reached within 15-30 min, remained elevated for about 9 hr and then declined with a half-time of 7.1 hr.', 'Following a single iv injection (1 mg/kg bw) of deoxynivalenol to swine, ... the elimination half-life was estimated at 3.9 hr.']"

The animal was sacrificed within 24 hours of administration of the final dose. Parent equivalent radioactivity found was 0.05 ppm, 0.1 ppm, 1.5 ppm, and 1.0 ppm in fat, muscle, kidney and liver, respectively. Radioactivity reached a plateau in milk on the second day (0.2 ppm). Analysis was performed using HPLC and TLC.', '[(14)C-aniline] thidiazuron was fed once daily at a dose exaggeration of 100x to six hens for fourteen days at a rate of 8 ppm. Radioactivity did not plateau in eggs during this period. All tissues were first treated with protease and beta-glucuronidase prior to extraction. Parent equivalent radioactivity found was 0.02 ppm, 0.27 ppm, 1.11 ppm, 0.66 ppm, 0.10 ppm, 0.10 ppm and 0.34 ppm in fat, gastrointestinal tract, gastro-intestinal tract contents, liver, muscle, skin and blood, respectively.', 'In a metabolism study groups of male and female Sprague-Dawley CD rats were dosed with (14)C-thidiazuron [((14)C-aniline) thidiazuron or ((14)C-thiadizaole) thidiazuron (purity: >97% a.i.; batch No: 1695-3 and 1695-4)] at a single oral gavage dose (10 or 1000 mg/kg) or 14-day repeated oral doses of thidiazuron at 10 mg/kg followed by a single oral dose of (14)C-thidiazuron at 10 mg/kg ... The results of the pilot study showed that less than 0.2% of administered radioactivity was eliminated as (14)CO2 from administration of either ((14)C-aniline) thidiazuron or ((14)C-thiadizaole) thidiazuron. In addition, the study showed no significant differences in the percentages eliminated through urine or feces from administration of the two radiolabeled forms. Absorption of thidiazuron was rapid but incomplete at both doses, and appeared decreased at the high dose relative to the low dose. Elimination of thidiazuron was relatively rapid at the single low oral dose level. The major route of elimination was shown to be via urine. The single low, single high, and multiple low oral dose studies indicate that the total radioactivity recovered within 5 days after dosing in the urine and feces were 91-104% of administered dose. At the low dose, the radioactivity recovered in the urine and feces was 60-66% and 29-31% of the dose over a 5-day period, respectively. At the repeated low oral dose, the radioactivity recovered in the urine and feces was 73-75% and 26-28% of the dose over a 5-day period, respectively. At the high dose, the radioactivity recovered in the urine and feces was 41-47% and 56-60% of the dose over a 5-day period, respectively. Administration of a single high dose resulted in a decreased percentage of thidiazuron derived radioactivity eliminated in urine (approximately 20%), with concomitant rise in fecal elimination. This alteration is likely due to reduced absorption of test material at the high dose. Terminal tissue distribution data showed that highest concentrations of thidiazuron derived radioactivity at sacrifice were found in the liver, kidneys, thyroid, whole blood and adrenals at both low and high doses. Repeated oral dosing did not significantly affect distribution of thidiazuron derived radioactivity.', 'In a dermal penetration study Thidiazuron (99.9 %a.i., batch # OR 1844 (SEL/1098), [phenyl-U-(14)C]-thidiazuron) was administered to 5 male Sprague Dawley CD rats/dose to a 12 sq cm area of the back in a formulation and water dilution thereof at dose levels of 5.0, 0.04 and 0.004 mg/sq cm ...

Permethrin residues were observed in the milk within 3 days at the two highest dietary levels; levels appeared to reach a plateau rapidly and not to increase with time. Analysis of individual cis and trans isomers showed that the ratio of permethrin isomers in milk appeared to change during the course of the study with the cis isomer predominating. Permethrin residues were not found in the tissues of animals that received doses of 1 mg/kg or less. At dose levels of 10 or 50 mg/kg, residues were detected in the tissues, predominantly in the fat.

The major metabolic reactions of both permethrin isomers /(trans and cis)/ were oxidation at the trans and cis portions of the gem-dimethyl group of the acid moiety and at the 2'- and 4'-positions of the alcohol moiety, ester cleavage, and the conjugation of the resulting carboxylic acids, alcohols, and phenols with glucuronic acid, glycine, and sulfuric acid. The cis isomer is more stable than the tans isomer, and the cis isomer yielded four fecal ester metabolites which resulted from hydroxylation  at the 2'- and 4'-positions of the phenoxy group, at the trans- methyl group, and at both of the two latter sites.

More than 87% of the radiocarbon from the four labelled perparations was found in the excreta 9 days after the initial dose, 0.7-4.7% of the dose was exhaled as (14)CO2, and 0.12-0.47% and 0.06-0.66% of the radiocarbon was recovered in egg yolk and fat (subcutaneous and visceral fat), respectively. Both the cis isomers labelled in the alcohol and acid moieties showed recoveries 3 to >10 times higher in the fat and egg yolk than those shown by the corresponding trans isomers. The excreta (0-72 hr) contained 1.7 times more cis-permethrin than trans-permethrin. Hydroxylated ester metabolites of trans-permethrin were not excreted, but four monohydroxy and dihydroxy esters (i.e. trans-OH-permethrin, 4'-OH-permethrin, 4'-OH, trans-OH-permethrin and trans-OH-permethrin sulfate) of cis-permethrin were found. Metabolites from the acid moieties of both isomers were the Cl2CA isomers in free, glucuronide, and taurine conjugate forms, trans-OH-Cl2CA, cis-OH-Cl2CA, cis-OH-Cl2CA lactone, and cis-OH-Cl2CA sulfate. trans-OH-Cl2CA was obtained from the cis isomer to larger extents than from the trans isomer, whereas the amounts of cis-OH-Cl2-CA were larger with the trans isomer than with the cis isomer. The metabolites from the alcohol moiety included PBalc, PBacid, their 4'-hydroxy-derivatives and the corresponding sulfate the glucuronide of PBalc, and a variety of unidentified conjugates of 4'-OH-PBalc and 4'-OH-PBacid. The taurine conjugate of PBacid was not detected. The metabolites produced in largest amounts were the unidentified conjugates of 4'-OH-PBalc (6-13% of the dose) and 4'-OH-PBacid (2-11%). The yolk of eggs 5 and 6 days after initial dosing contained 4.4 times cis-perethrin than trans-permethrin in unchanged form and the same ester metabolites of cis-permethrin as those found in the excreta. Other metabolites in the yolk were generally the same as those in the excreta. Overall, cis-permethrin appeared at higher levels than trans-permethrin in the egg yolk, fatty tissues, and excreta. Radiocarbon from cis-permethrin preparations also persisted longer in the blood than that from trans-permethrin preparations.

Some of these metabolic products were further oxidized and/or conjugated with glycine, glutamic acid and glucuronic acid. The major compounds found in feces after dosing with cis-permethrin were unmetabolized parent compound 4'-OH-permethrin, trans-OH-permethrin, PBalc, cis-OH-cis-Cl2CA-lactone and eight unidentified ester metabolites. The feces of goats treated with the trans isomer contained large amounts of the parent compound (41-79% of the fecal (14)C and of PBalc (8-25%) and cis-OH-trans-Cl2CA-lactone. Also, three unidentified ester metabolites were found (8-23%). On the other hand, major urinary metabolites from the alcohol moiety of both isomers were PBacid-glycine (7-9% of the urinary (14)C) and r'-OH-PBacid-glycine (4-12%). PBalc, PBacid, 4'-OH-PBalc, 4'-OH-PBacid, PBacid-glutamic acid and 4'-OH-PBacid-glutamic acid were also identified as minor metabolites. The urine of goats treated with both isomers contained as major components, Cl2CA in the free form (2-4% of the urinary (14)C) and as a glucuronide (27-71%). Cl2CA-glucuronide was obtained to a larger extent with the trans isomer than with the cis isomer. Other major metabolites of the cis isomer were cis-OH-Cl2CA (33) (9-11%) and cis-OH-cis-Cl2CA-lactone (11-16%). trans-OH-Cl2CA was detected as a minor metabolite of both isomers. The milk of goats contained the parent compounds, PBacid-glycine, and 4'-OH-PBacide-glycine. On administration of the cis isomer, a large amount of the parent compund was excreted in the milk than in the case of the trans isomer. Comparatively, when the trans isomer was administered, PBacid-glycine was detected in the milk to a larger extent than with the cis isomer.

Serial blood samples after oral and intravenous dosage, and brain, medulla oblongata, sciatic nerve, and liver samples after oral administration were collected. Plasma, hypothalamus, cerebellum, frontal cortex, caudate putamen, hippocampus, medulla oblongata, sciatic nerve, and liver concentrations of permethrin and its metabolites, m-phenoxybenzyl alcohol and m-phenoxybenzoic acid, were determined by a high-performance liquid chromatographic assay. The permethrin plasma profile could be adequately described by a two-compartment open model. For permethrin, the elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) and the mean residence time from plasma were 8.67 and 11.19 hr after i.v. and 12.37 and 17.77 hr after /peroal/ administration. The total plasma clearance was not influenced by dose concentration or route and reached a value of 0.058 liter/hr. After the single oral dose, permethrin was absorbed slowly with a Tmax of 3.52 hr. The maximum plasma concentration was 49.46 micrograms/ml. The oral bioavailability of permethrin was found to be 60.69%. The plasma concentration-time data for permethrin metabolites as well as the tissue concentration-time data for permethrin and its metabolites after an oral dose of permethrin were found to fit a one-compartment open model. The elimination half-life (t1/2el) of permethrin was greater for the hippocampus, medulla oblongata, frontal cortex, and sciatic nerve (23.10, 22.36, 13.86, and 16.27 hr, respectively) than for plasma (t1/2 beta, 12.37 hr). The maximum amounts of permethrin in cerebellum, hippocampus, caudate putamen, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, and sciatic nerve were about 1.5, 2, 2, 2.7, 4.8, and 7.5 times higher than in plasma, respectively, indicating an accumulation of pyrethroid by nervous tissue itself. Nervous tissue accumulation of permethrin was also reflected by the area under the concentration curve ratios of tissue/plasma (1.16, 3.71, 1.57, 4.27, 3.48, and 8.77, respectively). The metabolites of permethrin, m-phenoxy-benzyl alcohol and m-phenoxybenzoic acid, were detected in plasma and in all selected tissues for 48 hr after dosing, suggesting that a combination of metabolism by the tissues and diffusion into it from the blood may be present.', 'In studies, the half-life of (+)-trans- and (+)-cis-permethrin applied to the leaf surface of bean plants was 7 and 9 days, respectively.']"

Pregnant ferrets that ingested a single oral dose of Aroclor 1254 (approx 0.06 mg/kg) absorbed approximately 85% of the initial amount. Studies predominately of individual chlorobiphenyl congeners indicate, in general, that PCBs are readily and extensively absorbed by animals. These studies have found oral absorption efficiency on the order of 75 to > 90% in rats, mice and monkeys. A study of a non-Aroclor 54% chlorine PCB mixture prepared by the investigators provides direct evidence of absorption of PCBs in humans after oral exposure, and indirect evidence of oral absorption of PCBs by humans is available from studies of ingestion of contaminated fish by the general population. There are no quantitative data regarding inhalation absorption of PCBs in humans but studies of workers exposed suggest that PCBs are well absorbed by the inhalation and dermal routes. PCBs distribute preferentially to adipose tissue and concentrate in human breast milk due to its high fat content.', 'When Aroclor 1254 was fed to pheasants either as a single dose of 50 mg or as 17 weekly doses of 12.5 or 50 mg, up to 82% was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and up to 50 mg/kg (wet weight) were found in their eggs.', 'In Sherman rats given doses of 10 or 50 mg/kg body weight/day Aroclor 1254 on days 7-15 of pregnancy, the average PCB concentrations in fetuses taken by Caesarean section on day 20 of pregnancy were 0.63 and 1.38 mg/kg, resp, compared with less than 0.12 mg/kg in controls.', 'In cows fed 200 mg/day Aroclor 1254 for 60 days, the average concn in milk fat was 60 mg/kg (measured between the 40th and 60th days of feeding).', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for Aroclor 1254 (19 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","[""The metabolism of PCBs in experimental animals has been extensively reviewed. Many substrates have been tested, and the PCBs were usually administered by the oral or parenteral routes. In general, these studies showed that the metabolism rate of PCBs depends on the number and position of chlorine atoms on the phenyl ring and on the animal species. In rats, the elimination half-lives of four PCBs with one, two, five, or six chlorines increased as the number of chlorines increased. The decreased excretion rate with increasing chlorination was directly related to the decreased rate of metabolism of the more highly chlorinated congeners. Sheep liver microsomes converted 2,2',5-triCB to at least 5 more polar metabolites within 1 min and at least 10 metabolites by 15 min; however, within the homologous series, 2,2',5,5'-tetraCB and 2,2',4,5,5'-pentaCB were oxidized to only 3 metabolites at rates 7- and 14-fold slower, respectively. Not only does the number of chlorines affect the rate of biotransformation, but the position of the chlorines on the phenyl rings is also critical. This was demonstrated in rats, which excreted four symmetrical hexachlorobiphenyls at different rates depending on the chlorine positions. As the number of unsubstituted meta positions or adjacent unsubstituted carbon atoms increases, the percentage of the dose excreted increases. The major hydroxylated PCB metabolite in rat plasma after administration of 25 mg/kg Aroclor 1254 in peanut oil by gavage is 4-hydroxy-2,3,3',4',5-pentaCB. From days 1 to 14 after exposure, this metabolite is found at concentrations 7-10 times the concentration of the major PCB 153."", ""The metabolism of PCBs following oral and parenteral administration in animals has been extensively studied and reviewed, but studies in animals following inhalation or dermal exposure are lacking. Information on metabolism of PCBs in humans is limited to occupationally exposed individuals whose intake is derived mainly from inhalation and dermal exposure. In general, metabolism of PCBs depends on the number and position of the chlorine atoms on the phenyl ring of the constituent congeners (i.e., congener profile of the PCB mixture) and animal species. Although only limited data are available on metabolism of PCBs following inhalation exposure, there is no reason to suspect that PCBs are metabolized differently by this route.  Data exist on the in vitro hepatic metabolism and in vivo metabolic clearance of 2,2',3,3',6,6'-hexachlorobiphenyl and 4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl congeners in humans, monkeys, dogs and rats. The hexachlorobiphenyl congener is a constituent of Aroclor 1254. For each congener, the Vmax values for metabolism in the monkey, dog and rat are consistent with the respective metabolic clearance values found in vivo. Thus, the kinetic constants for PCB metabolism obtained from the dog, monkey and rat hepatic microsomal preparations were good predictors of in vivo metabolism and clearance for these congeners. In investigations directed at determining which species most accurately predicts the metabolism and disposition of PCBs in humans, the in vitro metabolism of these congeners was also studied using human liver microsomes. Available data suggest that metabolism of PCBs in humans would most closely resemble that of the monkey and rat. For example, the in vitro apparent Km and Vmax are comparable between humans and monkeys. These studies show consistency between the in vitro and in vivo findings and collectively indicate that metabolism of the two congeners is similar in monkeys and humans."", '... To study the possible role of non-parenchymal cells in the metabolism of xenobiotics, populations of non-parenchymal and parenchymal cells (PC) were prepared from rats and various xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme activites investigated. The specific activity of every enzyme studied (ethoxyresorufin deethylase, benzphetamine demethylase, glutathione transferase, UDP glucuronosyltransferase, and microsomal epoxide hydrolase) was 12 to 1000% higher in the parenchymal than in the non-parenchymal populations ... The non-parenchymal cells demonstrated a more dramatic induction of enzyme activities in Aroclor 1254-pretreated animals than did the parenchymal. Moreover, despite the generally lower enzyme activities, even after induction, the non-parenchymal were damaged by biologically inert xenobiotics which can be metabolized to reactive intermediates ...', 'The distribution of aminopyrine N-demethylase (APND), ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (ERRD), epoxide hydrolase (EH), and glutathione transferase (GST) activities in parenchymal (PC) and non-parenchymal (NPC) cell populations of control and Aroclor 1254-treated C57BL/6N and DBA/2N mice was determined. Furthermore, the metabolism of benzo(a)pyrene (BP) in parenchymal and non-parenchymal of both Aroclor 1254-treated mice strains was examined ... In non-parenchymal cells of both strains a low ratio of oxidative (epoxide aminopyrine N-demethylase and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase) post-oxidative (epoxide hydrolase and glutathione transferase) enzyme activities was observed. ... Treatment with Aroclor 1254 enhanced all the enzyme activities measured in parenchymal and non-parenchymal of both mice strains with the exception of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase in parenchymal and non-parenchymal of DBA/2N mice. This is due to the fact that the induction process of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase by aromatic and halogenated aromatic compounds such as Aroclor 1254 depends upon the presence of a cytosolic receptor with a high affinity for this type of inducers and the DBA/2N mice have a very poor affinity receptor. After incubating benzo(a)pyrene with parenchymal or non-parenchymal or Aroclor 1254-treated C57BL/6N mice significant amounts of 9,10-dihydrodiol, 4,5-dihydrodiol, 7,8-dihydrodiol, quinone, 9-hydroxy, and 3-hydroxy derivatives of benzo(a)pyrene were detected.', 'Differences in aryl-hydrocarbon-hydroxylase (AHH) inducibility by sodium phenobarbital or Aroclor 1254 were investigated in four strains of Drosophila-melanogaster. Berlin-K, D-melanogaster-Oregon-K, D-melanogaster-Haag-79, and D-melanogaster-Hikone-R adults (2 days old) were transferred to vials containing labeled cytochrome P-450 inducer. Concentrations of the inducers were 6.67 ug 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 0.2 mg benzo(a)anthracene (BA), 0.15 mg Aroclor 1254, and 3.0 mg sodium-phenobarbital. After 3 days of feeding, two males and two females were combined and homogenized for the fluorometric assay of aryl-hydrocarbon-hydroxylase. Cytosolic samplers from D melanogaster adults were incubated with labeled 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin or benzo(a)anthracene for 1 hr at 4 °C. High performance liquid chromatography was performed for the Ah receptor. Phenobarbital induced aryl-hydrocarbon-hydroxylase activity more than 10 fold in D-melanogaster-Berlin-K and D-melanogaster-Oregon-K and about 2 fold in D-melanogaster-Haag-79 and D-melanogaster-Hikone-R. Aroclor 1254 induced aryl-hydrocarbon-hydroxylase activity 2 to 4 fold in all the strains except D-melanogaster-Hikone-R. There was no significant aryl-hydrocarbon-hydroxylase induction by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin or benzo(a)anthracene in any of the four strains. In the presence of a 100 fold excess of nonlabeled benzo(a)anthracene competitor, no saturable high affinity low capacity benzo(a)anthracene binding moiety could be demonstrated in any of the four strains. High affinity 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin binding sites were observed by an excess of nonlabeled 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ...']","['Serum: 1-3 years; [TDR, p. 1035]', 'In 1977 and 1985, serum polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations were determined for 58 workers in a Bloomington, Indiana, factory that used polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in capacitor manufacture until 1977.

The phenyl ring is hydroxylated, the ester bond hydrolyzed, and the acid moiety is eliminated as the glucuronide and glycine conjugates.', 'Intravenous disposition kinetics /in a female black Bengal goat/ using a dose of 0.2 mg/kg showed that the maximum blood concentration of deltamethrin was recorded at 0.5 min, followed by rapid decline, and a minimum concentration was detected at 6 min after administration. The following values were obtained: Vdarea 0.148 (+ or -0.02) L/kg; t1/2 (a) 0.22 (+ or -0.02) min; t1/2 (beta) 2.17 (+ or -0.37) min; Kel 1.05 (+ or -0.24) /min; AUC 4.30(+ or -0.45)ug min/mL; ClB 0.05 (+ or -0.006) L/kg/min; T~B 1.93 (+ or -0.58); fc 0.40(+ or -0.05). After 10 min, liver retained the maximum residue, and heart, adrenal gland, kidney, spleen, fat and brain also held the insecticide; liver, fat, heart and spleen retained residue after 30 min, and bone, liver and fat retained residue after 60 min of iv administration. Oral absorption of deltamethrin was poor and inconsistent, and approximately 65% of administered dose was recovered from feces and gastrointestinal contents. The excretion of deltamethrin through urine was meager, and only 0.01 and 0.013% of the administered dose was recovered after 3 and 5 days of oral administration respectively. All the tissues retained the residue after 3 days; while fat, rumen, reticulum, omasum, abomasum, large and small intestine and bone retained the residue after 5 days of oral administration; and the percentage recoveries were 1.73 and 0.027 respectively. ...', 'Three young male human volunteers underwent a complete medical check-up one week prior to the morning of the study. Each of them received a single dose of 3 mg of (14)C deltamethrin mixed in 1 g glucose and diluted first in 10 mL polyethylene glycol300 and again in 150 mL water. Total radioactivity was 1.8 + or - 0.9 mBq. Samples of blood, urine, saliva, and feces were taken at intervals over 5 days. Clinical and biological examinations were performed every 12 hr during the trial and one week after its termination. Radioactivity in the biological samples was measured with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The clinical and biological checks did not detect any abnormal findings. There were no signs of side effects ... either during or after the trial period. The maximum plasma radioactivity appeared between 1 and 2 hr after administration of the product, and remained over the detection limit (0.2 KBq/L) during the 48 hr. The apparent elimination half-life was between 10.0 and 11.5 hr. The radioactivity of blood cells, as well as the saliva, was extremely low. Urinary excretion was 51-50% of the initial radioactivity; 90% of this radioactivity was excreted during the 24 hr following absorption. The apparent half-life of urinary excretion was 10.0-13.5 hr, which is consistent with the plasma data. Fecal elimination at the end of the observation period represented 10-26% of the dose. The total fecal plus urine elimination was around 64-77% of the initial dose after 96 hr.', 'In a feeding study, deltamethrin was administered twice daily to lactating dairy cows in portions of their daily feed at the rate of 2 or 10 mg/kg diet for 28 consecutive days. The level of 2 mg/kg diet was the residue level found in a recently treated pasture, whereas 10 mg/kg diet was five times this level. Deltamethrin residues in the milk were dose-dependent and appeared to reach a plateau between 7 and 9 days after the start of treatment. At the high deltamethrin intake of 10 mg/kg diet, the deltamethrin residue in milk was about 0.025 mg/L. Deltamethrin residues in tissues were measured 1, 4, and 9 days after the last dose. At the 10 mg/kg diet intake, very small amounts of deltamethrin residues were found in the liver (<0.005 mg/kg), kidney )<0.002 mg/kg), and muscle (0.002-0.014 mg/kg). Residues in fat were about 0.04 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg for the 2 and 10 mg/kg intake, respectively. Depletion of deltamethrin in milk was very rapid (estimated half-life was about 1 day); while in fat (renal and subcutaneous) the half-life was 7-9 days. Br2CA (3-(2,2-dibromovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopro-panecarboxylic acid) and PBacid (3-phenoxybenzoic acid) were the only metabolites detected in the milk and tissues of treated cows. In all cases, they were found at trace levels of < 0.0235 mg/L and < 0.034 mg/L, respectively. These two metabolites were also previously identified in rats and mice as the major degradation products of deltamethrin.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for DELTAMETHRIN (18 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","[""Deltamethrin (1 ug) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with each of the following mouse microsome preparations; a) tetraethyl pyrophosphate (TEPP)-treated microsomes (no esterase and oxidase activity); b) normal microsomes (esterase acivity); c) TEPP-treated microsomes plus NADPH (oxidase activity); and d)normal microsomes plus NADPH (esterase plus oxidase activity). Deltamethrin was more rapidly metabolized under the oxidase system than under the esterase system. The major site of ring hydroxylation was 4'-position and the secondary site was the 5-position. The trans methyl group was an important site of hydroxylation of the esters and cis methyl oxidation was evident in the metabolites of the cleaved acid moiety. The preferred sites of hydroxylation were as follows; trans of dimethyl group, 4'-position in the phenol group, and cis of the dimethyl group was equal to the 5-position in the phenoxy group. Cleavage of deltamethrin to cyanohydrin may result from both esterase and oxidase enzyme activities, since larger amounts of the cleaved products were evident in the oxidase system. ... However, at a much higher (approximately 35-fold) concentration of deltamethrin than that in the above study, it was not detectably hydrolysed. ... Deltamethrin was hydrolysed by esterases in the blood, brain, kidney, and stomach of mice yielding PBald and PBacid."", 'In a metabolic study, (14)C-deltamethrin was administered orally to lactating dairy cows at the rate of 10 mg/kg body weight per day for 3 consecutive days. It was poorly absorbed and mainly eliminated in the feces as unchanged deltamethrin. Only 4-6% of the administered (14)C was eliminated in the urine, and 0.42-1.62% was secreted in the milk. The radiocarbon contents of various tissues were generally very low with the exception of those of the liver, kidney, and fat, which were higher. Deltamethrin degradation occured by cleavage of the ester bond, as already reported in rats and mice. The enzymes responsible for the ester bond cleavage were located in cow liver homogenate, mainly in the microsomal fraction, as seen in an in vitro study. Metabolites resulting from ester bond cleavage further metabolized and/or conjugated, resulting in a large number of compounds excreted in the urine. In the milk, the major identifiable radiolabelled compound was deltamethrin.', ""The major metabolic pathways of deltamethrin in mice were similar to those in rats, though there were some differences. These included the presence of more unchanged deltamethrin in mouse feces than in rat feces. In mouse feces, there were 4 monohydroxy ester metabolites (2'-OH-, 4'-OH-, 5-OH-, and trans-OH-deltamethrin and one dihydroxy metabolite (4'-OH-trans-OH- deltamethrin) that were not found in mouse urine. Major metabolites from the acid moiety in mice were Br2CA, trans-OH-Br2CA, and their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Among them, trans-OH-Br2CA-sulfate was detected only in mice, but not in rats. Compared with rats, much larger amounts of trans-OH-Br2CA and its conjugates were formed in mice. A major metabolite of the alcohol moiety in mice was the taurine conjugate of PBacid in the urine, which was not detected in rats. Generally, mice produced smaller amounts of phenolic compounds compared with rats. Also, 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde (PBald), 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol (PBalc), and its glucuronide, and glucuronides of 3-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)benzyl alcohol (4'-OH-PBalc) and 5-hydroxy-3-penoxybenzoic acid (5-OH-PBacid) were found in mice, but not in rats. When mice were given an ip dose of (14) C-deltamethrin with or without piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and/or S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate (DEF), the same metabolites were obtained as with oral administration. However, DEF decreased the hydrolytic products relative to the controls, while PBO decreased the oxidation products."", ""Sulfate of 4'-OH-PBacid accounted for about 50% of the dose, together with small amounts of free (4%) and glucuronide forms (2%). The CN group was converted mainly to thiocyanate and, in small amounts, to ITCA. The trans-isomer of deltamethrin was also rapidly metabolized and yielded almost the same metabolties as deltamethrin, though 5-OH-derivative was found in the cis-isomer, but not in the trans-isomer."", 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for DELTAMETHRIN (19 total), please visit the HSDB record page.', ""Deltamethrin has known human metabolites that include 4'-hydroxy-deltamethrin.""]","['Following intravenous administration, the distribution and elimination half-times were ... 1.39 and 33.0 hours for deltamethrin.', 'In rats administered deltamethrin and its metabolite (4-OH-deltamethrin) intravenously, elimination half-times were 33 and 25 hours, respectively.', 'Deltamethrin has a half-life in rat brain of 1-2 days, but it is rather more persistent in body fat, with a half-life of 5 days.', 'Three young male human volunteers underwent a complete medical check-up one week prior to the morning of the study.

The water contained either complexing ligands such as nitrilotriacetic acid and natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) or competing cations such as Ca, Na, or H. After exposure, gills were excised and analyzed for total bound Co using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer. A Langmuir isotherm was used to calculate the conditional equilibrium binding constant (K) for Co binding to trout gills plus the concentrations of gill Co binding sites. The calculated binding constant for Co to trout gills was log KCo-gillCo = 5.1, with 88 nmol Co binding sites per g of wet gill tissue. Conditional equilibrium binding constants were also calculated for Ca, Na, and H binding to the gill Co sites and for Co binding to DOM. The experimentally determined binding constants were entered into an aquatic equilibrium chemistry program, MINEQL+, to predict Co binding by fish gills. Predicted and observed results indicate that Co would not accumulate on or in gills of trout held in a series of natural and 1:1 diluted natural waters supplemented with approximately 8.7 uM Co. Model analysis of the reasons for Co being kept off gills of trout held in natural waters indicated that Ca competition and DOM complexation were the most important factors in preventing Co binding by trout gills.']",,

It was concluded that the tolerance of dogs for the cmpd depended on their efficient hepatic extraction, metabolism, & excretion of it. The urine of poisoned rats & people contained the parent cmpd but the urine of dogs that had received it contained < 1%.', 'These studies compared the disposition of pyridyl- and nitrophenyl-1 [14C]RH-787 in tolerant and susceptible species. The compound was rapidly absorbed by rats, mice, and dogs after oral administration. Blood levels peaked in 1 to 6 hr, depending on species and label, and were higher after NP- than Py[14C] administration in each species. Doses of 30 mg/kg produced higher 14C levels in dogs than in rats-yet such dose levels are lethal to rats, but not dogs. G.I. transit of 14C was more rapid in dogs than in rats. Urinary and fecal excretion were of similar importance in all three species; NP label was more rapidly eliminated. Tissue distribution of two 14C labels varied, especially in dogs-suggesting more extensive metabolism. Liver contained more of the dose than any other single organ. Most hepatic 14C was located in the cytosol of each species, but rats and dogs differed in nuclear and microsomal fractions. Label differences in subcellular distribution were small when expressed as percentages of total liver 14C. Most 14C was reversibly bound to various organelle pellets. Rats tolerated, metabolized, and eliminated single or multiple sublethal RH-787 doses (5 mg/kg), but their metabolic systems were less efficient thant those of dogs for detoxifying larger doses (> 20 mg/kg). Pretreatment of rats with 3-MC enhanced their hepatic extraction of RH-787, increased biliary secretion of its metabolites, and protected rats against RH-787 toxicity. Thus, RH-787 tolerance in dogs seems to be related to effiicient hepatic extraction, followed by rapid metabolic degradation and excretion.']","['Several metabolites of pyriminil have been identified including aminopyriminil, acetamidopyriminil, p-aminophenyl urea, p-acetamidophenyl urea, p-nitroaniline, p-phenylenediamine, p-acetamidoaniline, nicotinic acid, nicotinuric acid & nicotenamide. Most of these metabolites were found in the urine of poisoned rats, dogs & people, but in different concentrations.', 'Repeated, sublethal doses of pyriminil incr the urinary & fecal excretion of latter dose of the cmpd tagged with (14)C; however, these same animals showed increased hexobarbital sleeping times & other evidence of inhibition of certain liver microsomal enzymes, especially p-nitro-anisole O-demethylase.', 'Analysis of liver from a human poisoning case demonstrated the presence of PNU & p-nitroaniline. It was suggested that p-nitroaniline was formed by amide hydrolysis of PNU.', ""Hepatic metabolism of the rodenticide RH-787 (N-3-pyridyl- methyl-N'- p-nitrophenyl urea) plays a key role in species sensitivity differences. 3-MC pretreatment of rats enhanced their hepatic extraction of 14C-787, increased biliary secretion of its metabolites and protected them against 787 toxicity. Dogs natively showed more efficient hepatic extraction of 787, leading to its rapid metabolic degradation. Rats tolerated chronic sublethal 787 levels, but most tissues showed 14C accumulation after multiple 14C-787 doses. Since this was more pronounced for pyridyl- than nitrophenyl-14C, metabolic cleavage products were suspected. Pretreatment of rats with multiple 787 doses enhanced urinary and fecal 14C excretion after pulse doses of 14C-787, but prolonged hexobarbital sleeping times and strongly inhibited hepatic p-nitroanisole O-demethylation in vitro; the latter was also inhibited by direct in vitro 787 addition. Antidotal levels of nicotinamide (NA) did not prevent MFO inhibition by 787, but altered 14C-787 disposition. Higher NA levels also inhibited the MFO. High affinity for microsomal enzymes may explain NAD-antagonism by 787 via glycohydrolase and make it useful as a model compound. Concentrates of urinary and biliary 787 metabolites and synthetic metabolites (amino-787, p-nitroaniline, p-nitrophenyl urea) were less toxic than 787."", ""Species selectivity of RH-787 (N-3-pyridylmethyl- N'-p-nitrophenyl urea) seems to depend on biotransformation. These studies compared fates of Py- and NP-14C-787 in rats and dogs. Human Vacor (pyriminil) metabolites were examined in poisoning cases. Although single oral 30 mg/kg doses of 787 were lethal to rats but not dogs, they produced higher blood levels in dogs. However, most 14C in rat blood was due to 787, while dog blood contained primarily p-nitrophenyl urea. Rat urine contained large amounts of 787 while dog urine had < 1%. Dog urine contained 40-60% unidentified polar material, but rat urine only 5-20%; this material from rats, but not dogs, was partially hydrolyzed by beta-glucuronidase to 787. Other identified metabolites include amino-787, acetamido-787, p-aminophenyl urea, p-acetamidophenyl urea, p-nitroaniline, p-phenylenediamine, p-acetamidoaniline, nicotinic acid, nicotinuric acid and nicotinamide. Most were found in all three species, but concentrations varied. The presence of parent compound in rat and human urine suggests that they may be more sensitive to Vacor because of inefficient metabolism. Tolerance in dogs is probably due to rapid detoxication.""]",

The effect of desogestrel on the lipids has been studied extensively and the results are contradictory.  Desogestrel main therapeutic effect due to its mechanism of action is known to be related to the inhibition of the ovulation in 97% of the cycles. This effect was proven in clinical trials in non-breastfeeding women from which the Pearl failure rate was reported to be of 0.17 per 100 women-years. This result indicated that desogestrel is more efficient when compared to other progestogen-only pills. All the therapeutic effect is produced by a transformation of the endometrium followed by an inhibition of the ovulation due to the suppression of other hormones.  Desogestrel has been widely confirmed to be related to an increase in the risk of venous thromboembolism due to the driven increased in blood coagulation factors, leading to a pronounced prothrombotic state. However, the effects of desogestrel are known to not impact significantly the level of total cholesterol remaining in the range of change of 10% which allows it to be a molecule that presents a favorable lipid profile.']","['Oral contraceptives which owe their effectiveness to hormonal preparations.

Azo dyes based on benzidine and benzidine congeners have received particular attention because of their widespread use and the known carcinogenicity of benzidine to humans. Azo dyes based on beta-diketone coupling components exist preferentially as the tautomeric hydrazones. A series of hydrazone dyes based on benzidine and benzidine congeners was prepared and characterized by NMR and UV-visible spectroscopy. These dyes were tested for mutagenicity using a modified Ames assay and, unlike the true azo dyes, showed no significant mutagenic activity. The hydrazone dyes were resistant to enzymatic reduction by FMN-supplemented hamster-liver post-mitochondrial supernatant (S-9); under identical conditions, azo dyes such as trypan blue were rapidly reduced.', ""Benzidine and several derivatives are activated to mutagenic species in an H2O2-dependent Ames test system. Optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy are employed in studies of the H2O2-dependent oxidation of benzidine and 3,5,3',5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) catalyzed by intact bacteria, and provide direct evidence for peroxidase activity in Salmonella typhimurium. The acetylase-proficient Ames tester strain TA98 and its acetylase-deficient derivative TA98/1,8-DNP6 are equally responsive to H2O2-dependent mutagenicity; enzymatic acetylation appears not to be involved in activation of benzidine, in this system. The H2O2-dependent mutagenicity of benzidine and oxidation of TMB are observed when the assays are carried out in acetate buffer (pH 5.5), but not in 2-[N-morpholino]ethane sulfonic acid (MES) buffer, at the same pH. This difference is interpreted in terms of the effects of these buffers on the intracellular pH of the bacteria. The H2O2-dependent mutagenicity of several benzidine congeners is also described."", 'Dichlorobenzidine can be peroxidatively activated in Salmonella typhimurium Ames tester strains. Mutagenicity is observed when an S. typhimurium strain which is sensitive to frame-shift mutagens is incubated with dichlorobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide. In this paper, we show that the bacterial enzyme, hydroperoxidase I, is responsible for much of this activation. We constructed isogenic tester strains which lack hydroperoxidase I or II, due to Tn10 insertions in the structural genes encoding these proteins. Hydrogen peroxide-dependent mutagenicity of dichlorobenzidine was measured in each strain. A tester strain lacking hydroperoxidase I activity was much less sensitive than was the parent strain. When hydroperoxidase I activity was restored in this strain, via a plasmid-borne copy of the gene encoding the Escherichia coli protein, sensitivity to peroxide-dependent dichlorobenzidine mutagenicity was enhanced.', 'An accumulation of insoluble, finely granular material has been observed under the pigmented surface of Xenopus eggs by a specialized ""dry fracture"" technique and scanning electron microscopy. Cortical granules and pigment granules can be recognized with the techniques and can be seen to be embedded in the material. Thin sections show that the region also contains mitochondria and membranous vesicles or reticula. Yolk platelets are largely excluded from the heaviest accumulations of the material. The substance is most dense just under the cortex and grades off gradually into the more diffuse, yolk-containing network of the endoplasm. The accumulation of material is much thicker in the animal hemisphere of the egg than in the vegetal hemisphere, and the pigment embedded in it defines the pigmented area of the animal hemisphere. In the pigmented area the material excludes yolk for a thickness of 3-7+ microns from the surface. In the vegetal hemisphere there is no such accumulation and yolk platelets can be found almost touching the plasmalemma. Cortical contractions have been experimentally induced in eggs. Their relative strength correlates with the relative thickness of the finely granular, subcortical material. During contraction the material accumulates to much greater thicknesses, excluding yolk from thicknesses of 15-30+ microns from the surface. The contracting entity is, or is in, the finely granular material. Injection of cytochalasins into the eggs inhibits cleavage furrow operation but does not inhibit the induced cortical contractions. The thus do not seem to be dependent on actin microfilamentogenesis as is the operation of the contractile ring of the cleavage furrow. The differential sensitivity to cytochalasins of the contractile ring and the system responding in the induced cortical contractions, suggests a two-component system for cortical contractions in the egg. A model is presented which accommodates the available data.', ""For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for 3,3',5,5'-TETRAMETHYLBENZIDINE (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.""]",

Some plants develop HERBICIDE RESISTANCE. (See all compounds classified as Herbicides.)']","[""In the province of Quebec (Canada), the phytocide Garlon 4, whose active ingredient is triclopyr, is often used to prevent trees from reaching electrical conductors. The object of this paper is to assess the potential health risks in workers coming into contact with Garlon 4. Ten workers collected their urine during the 22 hr following the beginning of a work shift. Measured urinary amounts of triclopyr varied between 1 and 13 mg. The absorbed daily doses were estimated from the amounts of triclopyr in urine through the use of a kinetic model that links the rates of triclopyr elimination to absorbed doses. These estimated doses were compared with the no-observed-effect level (NOEL) observed in rats: 5 mg per kg of body weight. The upper-bound estimations of the worker's daily absorbed doses were found to be 13.3% or less of the rat NOEL."", 'Two herbicides, 2,4-D and triclopyr esters (application ratio 1.6:1 acid equivalents) were applied as a tank mix by a crew of 8 backpack sprayer applicators, a mixer/loader, and a field supervisor. The crew was employed in a conifer release program in northern California during the summer of 2002. Biomonitoring (urine, 24 hr) utilized 2,4-D and triclopyr (a.e.) as rapidly excreted exposure biomarkers. The absorbed dosages of 2,4-D and triclopyr were calculated based upon cotton whole body suits and biomonitoring. Dosages based upon accumulation of the herbicides on body suits averaged 42.6 ug (a.e.) 2,4-D/kg-d and 8.0 ug (a.e.) triclopyr/kg-d. Six consecutive days of concurrent urine collections showed that backpack applicators excreted an average of 11.0 ug (a.e.) 2,4-D/kg-d and 18.9 ug (a.e.) triclopyr/kg-d. Estimates based upon curve fitting were 17.1 and 29.3 ug (a.e.)/kg-d, respectively. Results suggest that passive dosimetry for 2,4-D consistently overestimated the dosage measured using biomonitoring by a factor of 2-3 fold, while for triclopyr, passive dosimetry underestimated the absorbed dose based on biomonitoring by a factor of 2-4 fold.', 'Disposition and metabolism of (14)C-triclopyr acid (98.8% a.i.) was investigated in male and female rats at a low oral dose (3 mg/kg), repeated low oral doses (3 mg/kg x 14 days), and a high dose (60 mg/kg). Comparison of disposition data in intravenously dosed and orally dosed rats demonstrated that triclopyr was well absorbed after oral administration. Excretion was relatively rapid at the low dose, with a majority of radioactivity eliminated in the urine by 24 hours. At 60 mg/kg, urinary elimination of (14)C-triclopyr derived radioactivity was decreased in male and female rats from 0-12 hours, due to apparent saturation of renal elimination mechanisms. Fecal elimination of (14)C-triclopyr derived radioactivity was a minor route of excretion, as was elimination via exhaled air. No significant effect was observed on metabolism or disposition of (14)C-triclopyr from repeated low oral dosing in male or female rats. Residual (14)C-triclopyr derived radioactivity was minimal in all dose groups, but measurable levels of tissue radioactivity were detected in perirenal fat of both sexes and ovaries of female rats which apparently increased with dose. Thus, potential accumulation of (14)C-triclopyr derived radioactivity may occur in these tissues. Urinary metabolites of (14)C-triclopyr were isolated and identified by HPLC and GC/MS. Unmetabolized parent chemical represented >90% of urinary radioactivity, with the remainder accounted for by the metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (3,5,6-TCP), and possible glucuronide and/or sulfate conjugates of 3,5,6-TCP. Plasma elimination following intravenous administration of (14)C-triclopyr was consistent with a one-compartment model with an elimination half-life of 3.6 hr and zero-order kinetics from 0-12 hours at the 60 mg/kg dose. Kinetic parameters were optimized using SIMUSOLV modeling software. The model showed an apparent ""flip-flop"" phenomenon, in which absorption at the 3 mg/kg dose was rate limiting in elimination of (14)C-triclopyr derived radioactivity, but renal excretion was saturated and therefore limiting in elimination of (14)C-triclopyr derived radioactivity at the 60 mg/kg dose.', 'Blood levels and urinary excretion of triclopyr, the active ingredient in Garlon herbicides, were followed in six volunteers given single oral doses of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg body weight. Five of these volunteers later received dermal applications of Garlon 4 herbicide formulation equivalent to 3.7 mg triclopyr/kg body weight applied to the forearm. Following oral administration blood levels peaked at 2-3 hr and declined to undetectable levels within 48 hr; more than 80% of the dose was found as unchanged triclopyr in the urine. An average of 1.37% of the applied dose was recovered in the urine; when corrected for recovery after oral administration this was equivalent to an absorption of 1.65%. Triclopyr is slowly absorbed through skin and is rapidly eliminated. It has very low potential to accumulate in man or to be absorbed through the skin in acutely toxic amounts.']","['... 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (3,5,6-TCP) ... is the primary analyte found in /human/ urine as a result of exposure to ... triclopyr.', 'Disposition and metabolism of (14)C-triclopyr acid (98.8% a.i.) was investigated in male and female rats at a low oral dose (3 mg/kg), repeated low oral doses (3 mg/kg x 14 days), and a high dose (60 mg/kg). ...

Its primary therapeutic actions are analgesia and sedation. Sufentanil may increase pain tolerance and decrease the perception of pain. This drug depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils,. When used in balanced general anesthesia, sufentanil has been reported to be as much as 10 times as potent as fentanyl. When administered intravenously as a primary anesthetic agent with 100% oxygen, sufentanil is approximately 5 to 7 times as potent as fentanyl. High doses of intravenous sufentanil have been shown to cause muscle rigidity, likely as a result of an effect on the substantia nigra and the striate nucleus in the brain. Sleep-inducing (hypnotic) activity can be demonstrated by EEG alterations.  **Effects on the Respiratory System**  Sufentanil may cause respiratory depression.  **Effects on the Cardiovascular System**  Sufentanil causes peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Bradycardia may also occur. Clinical signs or symptoms of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes and sweating and/or orthostatic hypotension.  **Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract**  Sufentanil causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in both the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine may be delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased and lead to spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, as well as temporary elevations in serum amylase.']","['Agents that are administered in association with anesthetics to increase effectiveness, improve delivery, or decrease required dosage.

After epidural administration of incremental doses totaling 5 to 40 mcg sufentanil during labor and delivery, maternal and neonatal sufentanil plasma concentrations were at or near the 0.05 to 0.1 ng/mL limit of detection, and were slightly higher in mothers than in their infants.', 'Approximately 80% of the administered dose is excreted within 24 hours and only 2% of the dose is eliminated as unchanged drug.', 'Sufentanil has a distribution time of 1.4 minutes and redistribution time of 17.1 minutes. The central volume of distribution after intravenous application of sufentanil is approximately 14 L and the volume of distribution at steady state is approximately 350 L.', 'The total plasma clearance after single intravenous administration is about 917 l/min.  The clearance of sufentanil in healthy neonates is approximately one-half that in adults and children. The clearance rate of sufentanil can be further reduced by up to a third in neonates with cardiovascular disease.', 'This randomized double-blind investigation was designed to study the placental transfer and neonatal effects of epidural sufentanil and fentanyl infused with bupivacaine for labor analgesia. Healthy parturient women (n = 36) received epidural bupivacaine alone (group B) or with fentanyl (group B-F) or sufentanil (group B-S). Group B received a 12-ml bolus of 0.25% bupivacaine followed by a 10 mL/hr infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine. Groups B-F and B-S received a 12-mL bolus of 0.125% bupivacaine with 75 ug fentanyl or 15 ug sufentanil, respectively, followed by 10 mL/hr of 0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 1.5 ug/mL or sufentanil 0.25 ug/mL. Maternal venous (MV) and umbilical arterial (UA) and umbilical venous (UV) bupivacaine and opioid plasma concentrations were determined. Neonatal assessment included Apgar scores, umbilical cord blood gas analyses, and neurobehavioral testing at delivery and at 2 and 24 hr of life using the Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Score (NACS). The mean total dose of fentanyl was 136.6 +/- 13.1 micrograms (SEM), and of sufentanil, 23.8 +/- 1.8 micrograms. Although administered in a ratio of 5.7:1, fentanyl and sufentanil MV plasma concentrations were in the ratio of 27:1. UV/MV ratios were 0.37 for fentanyl and 0.81 for sufentanil. Fentanyl was detected in most UA samples, whereas sufentanil was present in only one sample. Neonatal condition was good and generally similar in all groups, with the exception of a lower NACS at 24 h in group B-F. Although the degree of placental transfer of sufentanil appeared greater than that of fentanyl, lower MV sufentanil concentrations resulted in less fetal exposure to sufentanil. The lower NACS at 24 hr in group B-F may reflect the continued presence of fentanyl in the neonate.', 'The effects of cirrhosis on the elimination kinetics and plasma protein binding of sufentanil were evaluated in 12 anesthetized patients with uncomplicated cirrhosis and these findings were compared with data from age-matched control anesthetized patients with normal hepatic and renal function. Sufentanil 3 ug/kg was given iv as a bolus injection and venous plasma concentrations were measured at intervals up to 10 hr. The average (+ or - standard deviation) elimination half life was 3.5 + or - 0.9 hr in controls and did not differ in cirrhotics: 4.1 + or - 0.6 hr. The plasma clearance did not differ between the two groups: 11.3 + or - 2.5 ml/min kg in controls and 10.8 + or - 4.6 ml/min kg in cirrhotic patients. The sufentanil free fraction was also similar in controls (8.3 + or - 1.5%) and in cirrhotic patients (9.6 + or - 1.8%). These data suggest that sufentanil in a single dose should have a similar duration of action in patients with uncomplicated cirrhosis and in normal patients.', 'The in vitro plasma protein binding and distribution in blood of fentanyl and three analogues were studied in rats, dogs and healthy volunteers. In human plasma, 84.4% of fentanyl was bound, 92.5% of sufentanil, 92.1% of alfentanil and 93.6% of lofentanil. Plasma protein binding of the four analgesics was independent of their concentration over the whole therapeutic range. Plasma protein binding of alfentanil was much less pH dependent than that of the three other analgesics. Attention was drawn to the possible contribution of the ""acute phase\' protein alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP), of lipoproteins and of blood cells to the binding of fentanyl and its analogues in blood.', 'The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of fentanyl, alfentanil, and sufentanil in isoflurane-anesthetized cats. Six adult cats were used. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. End-tidal isoflurane concentration was set at 2% and adjusted as required due to spontaneous movement. Fentanyl (10 ug/kg), alfentanil (100 ug/kg), or sufentanil (1 ug/kg) was administered intravenously as a bolus, on separate days. Blood samples were collected immediately before and for 8 hr following drug administration. Plasma drug concentration was determined using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Compartment models were fitted to concentration-time data. A 3-compartment model best fitted the concentration-time data for all drugs, except for 1 cat in the sufentanil group (excluded from analysis). The volume of the central compartment and the volume of distribution at steady-state (L/kg) [mean +/- SEM (range)], the clearance (mL/min/kg) [harmonic mean +/- pseudo-SD (range)], and the terminal half-life (min) [median (range)] were 0.25 +/- 0.04 (0.09-0.34), 2.18 +/- 0.16 (1.79-2.83), 18.6 +/- 5.0 (15-29.8), and 151 (115-211) for fentanyl; 0.10 +/- 0.01 (0.07-0.14), 0.89 +/- 0.16 (0.68-1.83), 11.6 +/- 2.6 (9.2-15.8), and 144 (118-501) for alfentanil; and 0.06 +/- 0.01 (0.04-0.10), 0.77 +/- 0.07 (0.63-0.99), 17.6 +/- 4.3 (13.9-24.3), and 54 (46-76) for sufentanil.

Sufentanil is rapidly metabolized to a number of inactive metabolites, with oxidative N- and O-dealkylation being the major routes of elimination.', 'Although the metabolic fate of sufentanil in humans has not been fully characterized, the drug appears to be metabolized mainly in the liver and small intestine via N-dealkylation at the piperidine nitrogen and O-demethylation. The O-demethylated metabolite appears to have about 10% of the analgesic activity of the unchanged drug. The hepatic extraction ratio of the drug (EH) has been reported to be about 0.72 following IV administration of a single 5-mcg/kg dose.']","['The elimination half-life is 164 minutes in adults when administered intravenously (IV). The elimination half-life of sufentanil is shorter (e.g. 97 +/- 42 minutes) in infants and children, and longer in neonates (e.g. 434 +/- 160 minutes) compared to that of adolescents and adults.  After a single administration of a 15 microgram sufentanil sublingual tablet, mean terminal phase half-lives in the range of 6-10 hours have been observed. After multiple administrations, a longer average terminal half-life of up to 18 hours was measured, owing to the higher plasma concentrations of sufentanil achieved after repeated dosing and due to the possibility to quantify these concentrations over a longer time period.', 'In adults with normal renal and hepatic function, the plasma half-life in the initial (distribution) phase averages 0.72-1.2 minutes, the plasma half-life in the second (redistribution) phase averages 13.7-17 minutes, and the plasma half-life in the terminal (elimination) phase averages 140-158 minutes. The elimination half-life is longer (434 minutes) in neonates but shorter in infants and children (97 minutes), compared with adults and adolescents.']"

In contrast, less than 2% of an oral dose was recovered in the urine as active (i.e., parent compound and active metabolite) drug.

This effect is obtained by increasing urine output and hence, facilitating fluid, acid-base and potassium control. This effect is obtained by the increase in the excretion of urinary sodium and chloride.  Several reports have indicated that torasemide presents a long-lasting diuresis and less potassium excretion which can be explained by the effect that torasemide has on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This effect is very similar to the effect observed with the administration of combination therapy with [furosemide] and [spironolactone] and it is characterized by a decrease in plasma brain natriuretic peptide and improved measurements of left ventricular function.   Above the aforementioned effect, torasemide presents a dual effect .in which the inhibition of aldosterone which donates torasemide with a potassium-sparing action.  Torasemide has been shown to reduce extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure in hypertensive patients suffering from chronic kidney disease. As well, some reports have indicated that torasemide can reduce myocardial fibrosis by reducing the collagen accumulation. This effect is suggested to be related to the decrease in aldosterone which in order has been shown to reduce the production of the enzyme procollagen type I carboxy-terminal proteinase which is known to be overexpressed in heart failure patients.']","['Drugs used in the treatment of acute or chronic vascular HYPERTENSION regardless of pharmacological mechanism.

Epirubicinol exhibits in vitro cytoxic activity (~10% that of epirubicin), but it is unlikely to reach sufficient concentrations in vivo to produce cytotoxic effects.', 'Epirubicin is extensively and rapidly metabolized by the liver and is also metabolized by other organs and cells, including red blood cells.

In this study, NADPH-supplemented human cardiac cytosol was found to reduce the carbonyl group in the side chain of the tetracyclic ring of doxorubicin, producing the secondary alcohol metabolite doxorubicinol (DOXol). A decrease in the level of alcohol metabolite formation was observed by replacing doxorubicin with epirubicin (EPI), a less cardiotoxic analogue characterized by an axial-to-equatorial epimerization of the hydroxyl group at C-4 in the amino sugar bound to the tetracyclic ring (daunosamine). A similar decrease was observed by replacing doxorubicin with MEN, a novel anthracycline with preclinical evidence of reduced cardiotoxicity. MEN is characterized by the lack of a methoxy group at C-4 in the tetracyclic ring and by intercalation of 2, 6-dideoxy-L-fucose between daunosamine and the aglycone. Multiple comparisons with methoxy- or 4-demethoxyaglycones, and a number of mono- or disaccharide 4-demethoxyanthracyclines, showed that both the lack of the methoxy group and the presence of a disaccharide moiety limited alcohol metabolite formation by MEN. Studies with enzymatically generated or purified anthracycline secondary alcohols also showed that the presence of a disaccharide moiety, but not the lack of a methoxy group, made the metabolite of MEN less reactive with the [4Fe-4S] cluster of cytoplasmic aconitase, as evidenced by its limited reoxidation to the parent carbonyl anthracycline and by a reduced level of delocalization of Fe(II) from the cluster. Collectively, these studies (i) characterize the different influence of methoxy and sugar substituents on the formation and [4Fe-4S] reactivity of anthracycline secondary alcohols, (ii) lend support to the role of alcohol metabolites in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, as they demonstrate that the less cardiotoxic EPI and MEN 10755 share a reduction in the level of formation of such metabolites, and (iii) suggest that the cardiotoxicity of MEN might be further decreased by the reduced [4Fe-4S] reactivity of its alcohol metabolite.', 'Many antineoplastic drugs were found to have carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic potential. The aim of this study was to carry out cytogenetic and internal dose monitoring of hospital pharmacy personnel regularly involved in the preparation of cytostatic agents, in order to test possible cytostatics-induced genotoxic effects due to occupational exposure under routine working conditions, and in cases of accidental contamination. ... Platinum in whole blood and anthracyclines in plasma were measured to assess internal exposure to cytostatics. The level of cytogenetic damage was determined in peripheral blood lymphocytes with the micronucleus test and the sister chromatid exchange assay. Five series of monitoring were performed over a period of 2 years. ... No significant differences in the mean frequencies of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and micronuclei (MN) were found between occupationally exposed probands and controls (9.9 +/- 1.4 vs 10.1 +/- 1.2 SCEs/cell and 21.2 +/- 7.2 vs 23.3 +/- 7.5 MN/2000 binucleated (BN) cells, n = 16). Significant elevations of SCE or MN were detected in seven out of 12 cases of accidental contamination at the workplace, whereas no increase in platinum in blood and anthracyclines in plasma was observed in these probands. Two cases of non-reported contamination were identified by measurement of epirubicin in plasma. Smoking was found to increase the SCE significantly. No correlation between individual SCE scores and MN scores was observed. ... /The authors/ findings support a transient increase in SCE or MN after relevant exposure to cytostatic drugs in cases of accidental contamination. The lack of significant differences in SCE and MN between hospital pharmacy personnel and unexposed controls, points to high standards of safety at the corresponding workplaces.', 'There is compelling in-vitro evidence that the evaluation of doxorubicin or epirubicin pharmacokinetics based solely on plasma concentration may not fully elucidate the differences between the two drugs. Both compounds bind to erythrocytes and their different binding to hemoglobin may influence their disposition in the body. The purpose of the present study was to compare the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of doxorubicin and epirubicin based on the plasma concentration, amount associated with blood cells and simultaneous monitoring of biliary and urinary elimination of unchanged drug and metabolites after single- and multiple-dose injections. The level of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase in the heart was also measured as a biomarker of cardiotoxicity. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated in a parallel design with doxorubicin or epirubicin on a multiple-dosing basis (4 mg kg(-1) per week) or as a single dose injection (20 mg kg(-1)). Blood, urine and bile samples were collected periodically after each dose in the multiple-dosing regimen and the single dose injection, and at the end of each experiment the hearts were removed. The concentrations of each drug in plasma, blood cells, bile and urine samples were determined, and by simultaneous curve-fitting of plasma and bile data according to compartmental analysis, the pharmacokinetic parameters and constants were estimated. The concentration of drug associated with blood cells was analyzed according to non-compartmental analysis. The bile and urine samples provided the in-vivo metabolic data. The level of Ca2+ATPase in the heart, determined by Western blotting, was used as the toxicodynamic parameterto correlate with the kinetic data. Multiple-dosing regimens reduced the total plasma clearance and increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of both drugs. Also, the area under the curve of doxorubicin associated with blood cells increased with the weekly doses, and the related mean residence time (MRT) and apparent volume of distribution (Vdss) were steadily reduced. In contrast to doxorubicin, the mean residence time and Vdss of epirubicin increased significantly. Metabolic data indicated significant differences in the level of alcohol and aglycones metabolites. Doxorubicinol and doxorubicin aglycones were significantly greater than epirubicinol and epirubicin aglycone, whereas epirubicinol aglycone was greater than doxorubicinol aglycone. The area under the blood cells concentration-time curve correlated linearly with the changes in Ca2+ATPase net intensity. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of the kinetics of epirubicin and doxorubicin associated with blood cells. Linear correlation between the reduction of net intensity of the biomarker with the area under the curve of doxorubicin associated with blood cells confirms that the differences between the two compounds are related to their interaction with blood cells. This observation together with the observed differences in metabolism may underline a significant role for blood cells in distribution and metabolism of doxorubicin and epirubicin.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for EPIRUBICIN (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['Half-lives for the alpha, beta, and gamma phases of about 3 minutes, 2.5 hours and 33 hours, respectively', '...

Eight healthy male volunteers first breathed 70% N2O/30% O2 for 30 minutes and then a mixture of SUPRANE (desflurane, USP) 2.0%, isoflurane 0.4%, and halothane 0.2% for another 30 minutes. During this time, inspired and endtidal concentrations (FI and FA) were measured. The FA/FI (washin) value at 30 minutes for desflurane was 0.91, compared to 1.00 for N2O, 0.74 for isoflurane, and 0.58 for halothane. The washin rates for halothane and isoflurane were similar to literature values. The washin was faster for desflurane than for isoflurane and halothane at all time points. The FA/FAO (washout) value at 5 minutes was 0.12 for desflurane, 0.22 for isoflurane, and 0.25 for halothane.

Metabolism also contributes significantly to the elimination pharmacokinetics of some volatile agents. Although innumerable studies have explored anesthetic metabolism in animals, there is little information on human volatile anesthetic metabolism with respect to comparative rates or the identity of the enzymes responsible for defluorination. The first purpose of this investigation was to compare the metabolism of the fluorinated ether anesthetics by human liver microsomes. The second purpose was to test the hypothesis that cytochrome P450 2E1 is the specific P450 isoform responsible for volatile anesthetic defluorination in humans. Microsomes were prepared from human livers. Anesthetic metabolism in microsomal incubations was measured by fluoride production. The strategy for evaluating the role of P450 2E1 in anesthetic defluorination involved three approaches: for a series of 12 human livers, correlation of microsomal defluorination rate with microsomal P450 2E1 content (measured by Western blot analysis), correlation of defluorination rate with microsomal P450 2E1 catalytic activity using marker substrates (para-nitrophenol hydroxylation and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation), and chemical inhibition by P450 isoform-selective inhibitors. The rank order of anesthetic metabolism, assessed by fluoride production at saturating substrate concentrations, was methoxyflurane > sevoflurane > enflurane > isoflurane > desflurane > 0. There was a significant linear correlation of sevoflurane and methoxyflurane defluorination with antigenic P450 2E1 content (r = 0.98 and r = 0.72, respectively), but not with either P450 1A2 or P450 3A3/4. Comparison of anesthetic defluorination with either para-nitrophenol or chlorzoxazone hydroxylation showed a significant correlation for sevoflurane (r = 0.93, r = 0.95) and methoxyflurane (r = 0.78, r = 0.66). Sevoflurane defluorination was also highly correlated with that of enflurane (r = 0.93), which is known to be metabolized by human P450 2E1. Diethyldithiocarbamate, a selective inhibitor of P450 2E1, produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of sevoflurane, methoxyflurane, and isoflurane defluorination. No other isoform-selective inhibitor diminished the defluorination of sevoflurane, whereas methoxyflurane defluorination was inhibited by the selective P450 inhibitors furafylline (P450 1A2), sulfaphenazole (P450 2C9/10), and quinidine (P450 2D6) but to a much lesser extent than by diethyldithiocarbamate. These results demonstrate that cytochrome P450 2E1 is the principal, if not sole human liver microsomal enzyme catalyzing the defluorination of sevoflurane. P450 2E1 is the principal, but not exclusive enzyme responsible for the metabolism of methoxyflurane, which also appears to be catalyzed by P450s 1A2, 2C9/10, and 2D6. The data also suggest that P450 2E1 is responsible for a significant fraction of isoflurane metabolism. Identification of P450 2E1 as the major anesthetic metabolizing enzyme in humans provides a mechanistic understanding of clinical fluorinated ether anesthetic metabolism and toxicity.', 'SUPRANE (desflurane, USP) is a volatile liquid inhalation anesthetic minimally biotransformed in the liver in humans.', 'Biotransformation and hepatotoxicity of desflurane were evaluated in the guinea pig liver slice culture system. Liver slices (250-300 microns) were prepared from 600-650-g male Hartley guinea pigs. The slices were incubated in sealed vials in a Krebs-Henseleit buffer at 37 degrees C under 95% O2. Desflurane was vaporized to produce media concentrations of 0.7-2.3 mM. After incubation (3-24 hr) viability of the slices was determined (K+ content; protein synthesis secretion) along with the biotransformation of desflurane (F-). Isoflurane (2.3 mM) was included in the studies for comparative purposes. Although desflurane caused a mild concentration-related reduction in slice K+ content (1.1-2.2 mM; 20%-40% of control), the effects were less than those produced by 2.3 mM isoflurane (50% of control). High concentrations of desflurane decreased protein synthesis at the first 9 hr of incubation, and isoflurane decreased protein synthesis throughout the incubation period. Neither anesthetic affected protein secretion. The biotransformation of desflurane was minimal with threefold less F- produced from desflurane than isoflurane.', 'The metabolism of desflurane has been assessed both in animals and humans by measuring the appearance of fluoride metabolites (fluoride ion, nonvolatile organic fluoride, trifluoroacetic acid) in blood and urine. Desflurane administered to rats (either pretreated or not pretreated with phenobarbital or ethanol) for 3.2 MAC-hours and to swine for 5.5 MAC-hours produced fluoride ion levels in blood that were almost indistinguishable from values measured in control animals. In contrast, a significant 17% increase in plasma fluoride ion concentration in swine was detected 4 hr after exposure to desflurane. In human studies, desflurane administered to patients (3.1 MAC-hours) and volunteers (7.35 MAC-hours) resulted in postanesthesia serum fluoride in concentrations that did not differ from background fluoride ion concentrations. Similarly, postanesthetic urinary excretion of fluoride ion and organic fluoride in volunteers was comparable to preanesthetic excretion rates. Small but statistically significant levels of trifluoroacetic acid were found in both serum and urine from volunteers after exposure to desflurane. Peak serum concentrations averaging 0.38 +/- 0.17 uM trifluoroacetic acid (mean +/- SD) and peak urinary excretion rates averaging 0.169 +/- 0.107 umol/hr were detected in volunteers 24 hr after desflurane exposure. Although these increases in trifluoroacetic acid after exposure to desflurane were statistically significant, they are approximately 10-fold less than levels seen after exposure to isoflurane. Desflurane strongly resists biodegradation, and only a small amount is metabolized in animals and humans.']",['Desflurane has a terminal elimination half life of 8.16 ± 3.15 minutes.']

The livers of these fish-eating birds were analyzed for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. Only congeners with a 2,3,7,8-chlorine substitution pattern were found in the livers. The major component was 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran and 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 1,2,3,7,8-pentachloridibenzo-p-dioxin were also present. Six pooled samples of the eel Anquilla anquilla showed the same congeneric pattern of chemicals as found in these bird species. In the eel, 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorobenzofuran and 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin were generally present in the 1-5 ng/kg range. Since the eel is the cormorant's major food, this indicates strong bioaccumulation for both congeners in the liver of the cormorant."", 'The polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and the polychlorinated dibenzofurans are predominantly stored in fat, but they are also excreted in milk and pass the placenta. They also appear in the blood and vital organs at lower concentrations. /Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/', 'Human adipose tissue samples obtained during autopsies in 5 Canadian municipalities within the Great Lakes basin were analyzed for polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans using GC-high resolution-MS. The mean congener values for male and female donors in each municipality are comparable with previously reported data. No significant differences in congener levels between male and female and between municipalities were detected. A positive correlation between congener level and age was observed for several congeners as well as for the total congener concn expressed as its 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin toxic equivalent.', 'The tissue distribution of 2,3,7,8-chlorine substituted dibenzo-p-dioxins was conducted in 11 patients who died of cancer. The concn of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was the highest in each organ and tissue and heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was also found at relatively high levels, second only to octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. The levels of 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in the spleen were the highest, respectively. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was also detected and its concentration was the highest in the gonad (0.8-3.2 pg/g-range). From the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin toxic equivalent calculations, the highest equivalent value was obtained from a 54 yr old female who died of cancerous goiter. This individual had the highest concentration of 2,3,7,8-substituted penta- and hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins among the 11 patients.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for 1,2,3,6,7,8-HEXACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN (8 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['In rats, primary hydroxylation of dibenzo-p-dioxins takes place exclusively at 2, 3, 7, or 8 position.', 'The metabolism of seven polychlorodibenzofuran isomers were studied in female Sprague Dawley rats. Bile samples were taken from surgically implanted bile duct cannulas over a period of 3 to 7 days, beginning 2 hr after dosing with the appropriate polychlorodibenzofuran isomer. Doses were administered either intravenously or by oral gavage. Metabolites were isolated from bile and analyzed as hydroxylated cmpd by GS/MS. The tetrachlorodibenzofuran isomers underwent rapid biotransformation. No ring opened products were seen, and both isomers were metabolized to hydroxylated tetrachlorodibenzofurans and trichlorodibenzofurans, and dihydroxy-trichlorodibenzofurans. The metabolites of the pentachlorodibenzofuran isomers showed quantitative differences in distribution; 1,2,3,4,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran metabolized primarily to hydroxy-pentachlorodibenzofurans, 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran resulted in dihydroxy-pentachlorodibenzofurans, and 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran metabolites were varied and resulted from ether bond cleavage. Neither 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzofuran nor 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzofuran resulted in discernible metabolite concn. It was concluded that polychlorodibenzofuran metabolism in rat liver is primarily due to oxidation, or hydrolytic or reductive dechlorination, that ether bond cleavage is a relatively unimportant metabolic mechanism, that chlorine substitution patterns affect metabolism, and that metabolism of polychlorodibenzofurans decreases with more than two chlorines in each ring.']","['1,2,3,6,7,8-Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin /was calculated/ to be about 3.5 yr.

Most of these compounds have been isolated from natural sources and antibiotics. However, they lack the specificity of the antimicrobial antibiotics and thus produce significant toxicity. The anthracyclines are among the most important antitumor drugs available. Doxorubicin is widely used for the treatment of several solid tumors while daunorubicin and idarubicin are used exclusively for the treatment of leukemia. Idarubicin may also inhibit polymerase activity, affect regulation of gene expression, and produce free radical damage to DNA. Idarubicin possesses an antitumor effect against a wide spectrum of tumors, either grafted or spontaneous.

Azone is thought to act by partitioning into skin lipid bilayers and thereby disrupting the structure. An open-label study was done with nine volunteers (two males, seven females; aged 51-76 years) in which Azone cream (1.6%; 100 mg) was topically dosed on a 5 x 10-cm area of the ventral forearm for 21 consecutive days. On days 1, 8, and 15, the Azone cream contained 47 uCi of (14)C Azone. The skin application site was washed with soap and water after each 24-hr dosing. Percutaneous absorption was determined by urinary radioactivity excretion. The (14)C Azone was ring labeled [14C-2-cyclo-heptan]. Radiochemical purity was >98.6% and cold Azone purity was 99%. Percutaneous absorption of the first dose (day 1) was 1.84 +/- 1.56% (SD) of applied dose for 24-hr skin application time. Day 8 percutaneous absorption, after repeated application, increased significantly (p<0.002) to 2.76 +/- 1.91%. Day 15 percutaneous absorption, after continued repeated application, stayed the same at 2.72 +/- 1.21%. In humans, repeated application of Azone results in an initial self-absorption enhancement, probably due to its mechanism of action. However, steady-state percutaneous absorption of Azone is established after this initial change. Thus, Azone can enhance its own absorption as well as that of other compounds. This should be considered relevant for any pharmacological or toxicological evaluation. Washing the skin site of application with soap and water only recovered 1-2% of applied radioactivity. Previous published studies recovered the Azone dose with ethanol washes. Thus, there could potentially be an accumulation of Azone in skin.']",,

Residues in tissues were generally low and there was no evidence for accumulation or retention of propiconazole or its metabolites.', 'Male and female mice were fed a diet containing 5, 100 and 2500 ppm propiconazole for 21 days, followed by a single oral dose of (14C)-phenyl propiconazole at a mean corresponding dose level (0.8/1.0, 16.8/21.5 and 434/475 mg/kg bw for males/females). Urinary excretion accounted for 45-81% of the administered dose after 96 hours and tended to be higher by males than by females. In the feces 22-43% was excreted. At the lowest dose level (5 ppm propiconazole) the residual radioactivity in blood, liver, kidneys, lungs and in the remaining carcass was below 0.02 mg/kg propiconazole equivalents and accordingly higher at the 100 and 2500 ppm dose level. Residues in female mice were higher than in male mice, except in the kidneys where the males showed higher or equal values. Independent of the dose level and sex of the animals, the highest residues were found in the liver, up to 2.3 and 3.0 mg/kg in males and females of the highest dose level, respectively.', 'Orally administered single doses (0.5 and 25 mg/kg bw) of triazole labelled (3,5-14C)-propiconazole to rats were rapidly excreted within 24 hours (74-84%). After 6 days, 0.04-0.15%, 28-46% and 53-67% had been recovered from expired air, feces and urine respectively. Only about 0.4% of the administered dose remained in the tissues. Highest tissue residues were found in liver, blood and kidneys. No unchanged propiconazole was excreted in the urine. Within 3 days after treatment of male rats with a single oral dose of about 32 mg/kg bw of triazole labelled (3,5-14C)-propiconazole or a phenyl-(U-14C) labelled propiconazole, more than 95% of the dose was excreted. Of this, 52% was found in the urine and 43-48% in the feces. The excretion pattern for both compounds was identical with no administered compound being found in the urine.', 'Single doses of triazole-14C-propiconazole (1.0 and 10.0 mg/kg bw) applied dermally to rats were absorbed through the skin following first order kinetics with half-lives averaging 24-31 hours for low and high dosed rats, respectively. Equal amounts of the dose were excreted within 72 hours in urine and feces. The amount of residual radioactivity on the skin averaged 20% of the applied dose.', 'Feed consumption, milk production or the general health of a lactating goat were not affected after the daily oral administration of 5 mg triazole-14C-propiconazole for 10 consecutive days (which would correspond to 4.5 ppm in the feed). Of the total dose, 89% was excreted within 24 hours after the last administration (68% and 21% in urine and feces, respectively). All tissues contained less than 0.02 mg/kg propiconazole equivalents, except liver (0.096 mg/kg) and kidney (0.029 mg/kg). The total radioactivity secreted with the milk reached a plateau at day three of 0.013-0.016 mg/kg, representing 0.18% of the total dose.']","['The metabolism of orally administered (14C)-phenyl propiconazole was studied in mice pretreated with unlabeled propiconazole followed by a single oral dose of (14C)-phenyl propiconazole at a corresponding dose level. The urinary metabolite pattern of propiconazole demonstrated a marked sex dependency. In male mice, 60% of the radioactivity in 0-24 hour urine was represented by one metabolite, this metabolite accounted for 30% in the 0-24 hour urine in female mice. This metabolite was identified by spectroscopy as the glucuronic acid conjugate of 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1 H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl) ethanol. This demonstrates that the major metabolic pathway in mice involves dioxolane ring cleavage.', 'The metabolism of propiconazole was investigated in male rats administered a single oral dose of 31.4 mg/kg triazole-(3,5-14C-propiconazole). Metabolites were isolated from first day urine and feces excretion representing 44.5% and 36.2% of the applied dose, respectively. A wide array of biotransformations occurred leading to numerous metabolites. The major site of enzymatic attack oxidation of the propyl side chain leading via alcohols and diols to carboxy acids and alpha-hydroxy carboxy acid or cleavage of the dioxolane ring. The majority of the alcoholic and phenolic metabolites are renally excreted as sulfuric acid and glucuronic acid conjugates. In the rat the main metabolite is the alpha hydroxyl carboxylic acid of propiconazole.', '/In rats/...the major sites of enzymic attack are the propyl side-chain and the cleavage of the dioxolane ring, together with some attack at the 2,4-dichlorophenyl and 1,2,4-triazole rings. In mice, the major metabolic pathway is via cleavage of the dioxolane ring.']",['Half-live averages 24-31 hours /in rats/.']

Due to the first-pass metabolism, the bioavailability ranges from 30-60%. Cmax is attained 2 to 8 hours after an oral dose. Mean Tmax is 4.3 hours in healthy patients.  The steady-state concentration of paroxetine is achieved within 7 to 14 days of oral therapy. In a pharmacokinetic study, AUC in healthy patients was 574 ng·h/mL and 1053 ng·h/mL in those with moderate renal impairment.', 'About 2/3 of a single paroxetine dose is found to be excreted in the urine and the remainder is found to be excreted in feces. Almost all of the dose is eliminated as metabolites; 3% is found to be excreted as unchanged paroxetine. About 64% of a 30 mg oral dose was found excreted in the urine, with 2% as the parent drug and 62% appearing as metabolites. Approximately 36% of the dose was found to be eliminated in the feces primarily as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound.', 'Paroxetine has a large volume of distribution and is found throughout the body, including in the central nervous system. Only 1%  of the drug is found in the plasma. Paroxetine is found in the breast milk at concentrations similar to the concentrations found in plasma.', 'The apparent oral clearance of paroxetine is 167 L/h. The clearance of paroxetine in patients with renal failure is significantly lower and dose adjustment may be required, despite the fact that it is mainly cleared by the liver. Dose adjustments may be required in hepatic impairment.', 'Paroxetine hydrochloride appears to be slowly but well absorbed from the GI tract following oral administration. Although the oral bioavailability of paroxetine hydrochloride in humans has not been fully elucidated to date, the manufacturer states that paroxetine is completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. However, the relative proportion of an oral dose that reaches systemic circulation unchanged appears to be relatively small because paroxetine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The oral tablets and suspension of paroxetine hydrochloride reportedly are bioequivalent.', 'In steady-state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of 20 mg to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 mg to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway.

Genetic polymorphisms of the CYP2D6 enzyme may alter the pharmacokinetics of this drug. Poor metabolizers may demonstrate increased adverse effects while rapid metabolizers may experience decreased therapeutic effects.   The majority of a paroxetine dose is oxidized to a catechol metabolite that is subsequently converted to both glucuronide and sulfate metabolites via methylation and conjugation. In rat synaptosomes, the glucuronide and sulfate conjugates have been shown to thousands of times less potent than paroxetine itself. The metabolites of paroxetine are considered inactive.', 'The exact metabolic fate of paroxetine has not been fully elucidated; however, paroxetine is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared by the body. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and the principal metabolites have been isolated and identified. The metabolites of paroxetine have been shown to possess no more than 2% of the potency of the parent compound as inhibitors of serotonin reuptake; therefore, they are essentially inactive.', 'Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug-drug interactions', 'Paroxetine has known human metabolites that include 4-[[(3S,4R)-4-(4-Fluorophenyl)piperidin-3-yl]methoxy]benzene-1,2-diol.']","['The mean elimination half-life of paroxetine is about 21 hours.

The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain its effects by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure.']","['A class of drugs whose main indications are the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.

The anaerobic metabolism of these isomeric nitro-BaPs was investigated by the incubation of rat intestinal microflora with each isomer for 48 hr. Aliquots were removed at several time intervals, extracted, fractionated by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the radioactivity determined. Metabolites were identified by comparison of their chromatographic, ultraviolet-visible absorption, and mass spectral properties with those of authentic standards. The order of the extent of nitroreduction for these isomers was 3-nitro-BaP greater than 6-nitro-BaP greater than 1-nitro-BaP. After 48 hr of exposure, 84% of the added 3-nitro-BaP was present as 3-amino-BaP, 51% of the 6-nitro-BaP was metabolized to 6-amino-BaP, and 1-nitro-BaP was reduced to 1-amino-BaP (13%) and 1-nitroso-BaP (4%). The order of the extent of microbial nitroreduction for these nitro-BaP isomers is different from the predictions based on electronic and steric hindrance effects. These results suggest that intestinal microflora nitroreductases exhibit a markedly high degree of substrate specificity toward nitro-BaPs that affects the extent of nitroreduction.']",

NNK and NNAL have been detected in the saliva of smokeless tobacco users, and NNAL and another metabolite of NNK, NNAL-glucuronide, have been quantified in human urine. The presence of these metabolites, which are specific to exposure to tobacco products (e.g. in smokers, users of smokeless tobacco and nonsmokers exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke), signals human uptake and metabolism of NNK, and their quantification allows an estimation of the dose of NNK absorbed. Dose calculations show that the total amounts of NNK taken up by people who used tobacco products for a period of 30 years or more approximate the total amounts that induce tumors in rats.', 'Absorption of NNK in smokeless tobacco users was demonstrated by the detection of its metabolites, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) and NNAL-glucuronide (Gluc), in plasma and urine and of NNAL-N-oxide in urine. Similar results have been obtained in smokers, although only NNAL has been reported in plasma. NNAL-N-Gluc comprised 50 +/- 25% of total NNAL-Gluc in the urine of smokers and 24 +/- 12% in snuff-dippers. Toombak users excreted exceptionally high levels of NNAL and NNAL-Gluc (0.12 to 0.14 mg per day), which demonstrated a higher uptake of NNK by humans than of any other non-occupational carcinogen.', '4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), but not NNAL-Gluc, was detected in the amniotic fluid of mothers who smoked. Both NNAL and NNAL-Gluc were detected in the urine of neonates born to mothers who smoked, but not in the urine of newborns of nonsmoking mothers. These results indicate that NNK is converted to NNAL in the mother, and that NNAL crosses the placental barrier and is absorbed and metabolized to NNAL-Gluc in the late stages of fetal development. /NNAL/', '4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) and NNAL-Gluc are excreted in the urine more slowly than would be expected, based on their structures, after cessation of smoking or smokeless tobacco use. One week after smoking cessation, 34.5% of baseline NNAL plus NNALGluc was detected in urine, whereas the corresponding values for the structurally related compounds cotinine and nicotine were 1.1 and 0.5%, respectively. Even 6 weeks after cessation, 7.6% of the original levels of NNAL plus NNAL-Gluc remained. The distribution half-life of NNAL and NNAL-Gluc was 3 to 4 days, while the elimination half-life was 40 to 45 days. Total body clearance of NNAL was estimated to be 61.4 +/- 35.4 mL/min, and the volume of distribution in the beta-phase was estimated to be 3800 +/- 2100 L, which indicates substantial distribution into tissues. After cessation of smokeless tobacco use, the distribution half-lives of NNAL (1.32 +/- 0.85 versus 3.35 +/- 1.86 days) and NNAL-Gluc (1.53 +/- 1.22 versus 3.89 +/- 2.43 days) were significantly shorter than those in smokers. There were no significant differences in the terminal half-lives. /NNAL/', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for 4-(N-Nitrosomethylamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (10 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['NNK uptake by measurement of the urinary metabolites 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol and its glucuronides (total NNAL) has been reported in many studies, but there are no data in the literature on the percentage of the NNK dose that is converted to NNAL in smokeless tobacco users. ... 15 male subjects abstained from tobacco use for 3 weeks before placing 2 g smokeless tobacco between their cheeks and gums for 30 min. They then continued abstinence and collected three consecutive 24-hr urine samples. The amount of NNK in the tobacco before and after use was determined along with the amount in expectorated saliva. The NNK dose thus calculated was compared with the amount of total NNAL excreted in the next 72 hr. These data, taken together with previous pharmacokinetic data, show that the percent conversion of NNK to total NNAL in smokeless tobacco users is approximately 14% to 17%. This figure can be used to calculate daily exposure to NNK in smokeless tobacco users ( approximately 6 ug). The results of this study also indicate that metabolic activation of NNK to intermediates that can react with DNA is its major pathway of metabolism in smokeless tobacco users.', 'NNK can be converted to the pyridine oxidation products 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-[3- (6-hydroxypyridyl)]-1-butanone (6-HONNK) and NNK-N-oxide. Denitrosation of NNK followed by oxidation produces myosmine. NNK can replace nicotinamide in NADP+ or NADPH, to yield NNK adenosine dinucleotide phosphate ((NNK)ADP+) and (NNK)ADPH (reduced form). Carbonyl reduction of NNK produces NNAL which can be conjugated by glucuronidation giving four diastereomers of NNAL-Gluc: two isomers of 4- (methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-(O-beta-D-glucopyranuronosyl)butane (NNAL-O-Gluc) and two isomers of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl-N-beta-D-glucopyranuronosyl)-1- butanolonium inner salt (NNAL-N-Gluc). NNAL is also converted to NNAL-N-oxide and NNAL(ADP+).', 'Alpha-Hydroxylation of NNK and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) leads to DNA and hemoglobin adducts. Hydroxylation of the NNK methyl group gives 4-(hydroxymethylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (alpha-HOMeNNK) which can be conjugated as a glucuronide, alpha-HOMeNNK-Gluc. -HOMeNNK spontaneously decomposes to 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanediazohydroxide (POB-DZH) and formaldehyde. POB-DZH reacts with water to give 4-hydroxy-1-(3-pyridyl)- 1-butanone (HPB) which can be conjugated as its glucuronide, HPB-Gluc. POB-DZH also reacts with DNA and haemoglobin to produce a series of adducts. Alpha-Hydroxylation of the NNK methylene group produces 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)- 1-(4-hydroxy)butanone (alpha-HOMethyleneNNK). This metabolite spontaneously decomposes to 4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobutanal (keto aldehyde) and methanediazohydroxide (Me- DZH). Keto aldehyde is further metabolized to 4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (keto acid) which in turn can be converted to 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl)butanoic acid (hydroxy acid). Me-DZH reacts with water to yield methanol and with DNA to produce methyl adducts as shown in Figures 2 and 5. NNAL similarly undergoes alpha-hydroxylation at its methylene group to yield 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-(4-hydroxy)butanol (alpha-HOMethyleneNNAL) and at its methyl group to yield 4-(hydroxymethylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)- 1-butanol (alpha-HOMeNNAL). Alpha-HOMethyleneNNAL spontaneously decomposes to Me- DZH and 5-(3-pyridyl)-2-hydroxytetrahydrofuran (lactol), which can be converted to hydroxy acid. Alpha-HOMeNNAL spontaneously decomposes to 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl)-1- butanediazohydroxide (PHB-DZH) and formaldehyde. PHB-DZH reacts with water to yield 4-(3-pyridyl)butane-1,4-diol (diol), cyclizes to 2-(3-pyridyl)tetrahydrofuran (pyridylTHF) and reacts with DNA and hemoglobin to produce adducts.', 'CYPs are the major catalysts of NNK alpha-hydroxylation in humans and rodents. ... The relative efficiencies in NNK metabolism by human CYP are (from greatest catalyst to least): 2A13 > 2B6 > 2A6 > 1A2 ~ 1A1 > 2D6 ~ 2E1 ~ 3A4. ... The actual involvement of these enzymes in NNK metabolism in vivo depends on many factors that include relative expression levels, the amount of CYP oxido-reductase expressed in a given tissue, tissue localization and inducibility of individual CYPs, and the concentration of NNK in human tissues. Among hepatic CYPs, 2B6 has the highest affinity for NNK. However, low levels of this enzyme are present in most liver samples. CYP2A6 is also present at relatively low levels, and accounts for < 1% to 4% of the total CYP content. Levels of CYP1A2 are four- to 20-fold higher than those of CYP2A6. Therefore, despite its somewhat higher Km and lower Vmax/Km, CYP1A2 is most probably as important a catalyst of NNK alpha-hydroxylation in human liver as CYP2A6. CYP3A4 may also play a role in hepatic NNK alpha-hydroxylation, since it is often present at concentrations that are 10 to 50 times greater than those of CYP2A6. It is not possible to rule out completely the presence of CYP2A13, the best known human catalyst of NNK metabolism, in the liver. However, the very low hepatic mRNA levels of CYP2A13 relative to CYP2A6 suggest that, if this enzyme is present, it is so at very low levels. Results to date do not identify that any single CYP in the liver is a key player in NNK activation. Several enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, clearly play a role. The relative contribution of any one of these CYPs varies among individuals, and their relative abundance and catalytic efficiencies suggest that rarely, if ever, is one of them the dominant catalyst.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for 4-(N-Nitrosomethylamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (19 total), please visit the HSDB record page.', '4-(Methylnitrosoamino)-1-(3-pyridinyl)-1-butanone (NNK) has known thirdhand smoke metabolites that include 1-(3-Pyridinyl)-1,4-butanediol (1,4-Diol), 1-(Methylnitrosoamino)-4-(3-pyridinyl)-1,4-butanediol, 2-Hydroxy-1-pyridin-3-ylpropan-1-one, 3-(Oxolan-2-yl)pyridine, 4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), 4-Hydroxy-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (HPB), 4-Hydroxy-4-(methylnitrosoamino)-1-(3-pyridinyl)-1-butanone, 4-Hydroxy-4-pyridin-3-ylbutanal, 4-Oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)-butanoic acid (OPBA), 4-Oxo-4-(pyridin-3-yl)butanal, 4-Oxo-4-pyridin-3-ylbutane-1-diazonium, 4-[(Hydroxymethyl)nitrosoamino]-1-(3-pyridinyl)-1-butanone, 4-hydroxy-4-(3-pyridyl)-butanoic acid (HPBA), 5-(3-Pyridyl))-2-hydroxytetrahydrofuran (lactol), 5-(3-Pyridyl)-tetrahydro-furan-2-one(lactone), NNAL-N-Oxide, NNAL-N-glucoronide, NNAL-O-glucoronide, NNK-N-Oxide, alpha-[3-[(Hydroxymethyl)nitrosoamino]propyl]-3-pyridinemethanol, and iso-NNAL.', 'NNK has known human metabolites that include 4-[(Hydroxymethyl)nitrosoamino]-1-(3-pyridinyl)-1-butanone.']",

Atracurium can be used most advantageously if muscle twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation is monitored to assess degree of muscle relaxation. The duration of neuromuscular block produced by Atracurium is approximately one third to one half the duration of block by d-tubocurarine, metocurine, and pancuronium at initially equipotent doses. As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers, the time to onset of paralysis decreases and the duration of maximum effect increases with increasing doses of Atracurium. Repeated administration of maintenance doses of Atracurium has no cumulative effect on the duration of neuromuscular block if recovery is allowed to begin prior to repeat dosing. Moreover, the time needed to recover from repeat doses does not change with additional doses. Repeat doses can therefore be administered at relatively regular intervals with predictable results.']","['Drugs that interrupt transmission at the skeletal neuromuscular junction without causing depolarization of the motor end plate.

It causes sustained dilation of both the arterial resistance and conductive vessels that increases coronary blood flow, however the effect of the drug on coronary arteries does not involve the coronary steal phenomenon. Activation of potassium channels lead to hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle cells, followed by arterial dilation and afterload reduction. Nicorandil is shown to increase pooling in the capacitance vessels with a decrease in preload through relaxing the venous vascular system. Overall, improved blood flow and reduced infarct size are achieved through reduction of end-diastolix pressure and decreased extravascular component of vascular resistance.

The organs in which residues have been reported are the liver, kidneys, brain, fat, and muscle.The half-life in the rat is of the order of 3 - 8 hr.

Carbofuran and 3-hydroxycarbofuran were detected in plasma and urine rather than furathiocarb. 3-Ketocarbofuran, another potential metabolite, was not observed in any sample. The concentration of carbofuran was higher than that of 3-hydroxycarbofuran in plasma, but the reverse was the case in urine. The corresponding area under the plasma concentration-time curve, Tmax, and Cmax values of carbofuran and 3-hydroxycarbofuran for 1,500 mg/kg doses were 2.4-8.0 mg equiv/ml, 12 hr and 0.1-0.4 mg equiv/ml, respectively. T1/2 was calculated only for 3-hydroxycarbofuran (28 hr). Two metabolites were excreted in a dose-dependent manner without saturation.']","['Metabolic transformation in rats proceeds via rapid and complete hydrolysis, followed by oxidation and conjugation. Excretion occurs mainly via kidney.', 'The first step in the metabolism of carbamates is hydrolysis to carbamic acid, which decomposes to carbon dioxide (CO2) and the corresponding amine. The mechanism of hydrolysis is different for  N -methyl and  N-dimethyl derivatives.  The  N-methyl carbamates pass through an isocyanate intermediate, whereas in the hydrolysis of  N-dimethylcarbamates, an addition product with a hydroxyl ion is formed yielding the alcohol and  N-dimethyl substituted acid.  The rate of hydrolysis by esterases is faster in mammals than in plants and insects. Apart from hydrolysis, oxidation also takes place including: hydroxylation of the aromatic ring,  O-dealkylation,  N -methyl hydroxylation,  N-dealkylation, oxidation of aliphatic side chains, and sulfoxidation to the corresponding sulfone. Oxidation is associated with the mixed-function oxidase (MFO) enzymes. Conjugation leads to the formation of  O- and  N- glucuronides, sulfates, and mercapturic acid derivatives in mammals.  Glycosides and phosphates are conjugation products more common in plants. /Carbamate Pesticides/', 'The pharmacokinetics of furathiocarb were studied in vivo in male Sprague-Dawley rats following dermal treatment.

It was withdrawn from the US and Canadian markets in 2007 due to an increased risk of cardiac valvulopathy.""]","['Pergolide stimulates centrally-located dopaminergic receptors resulting in a number of pharmacologic effects. Five dopamine receptor types from two dopaminergic subfamilies have been identified. The dopaminergic D1 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>5</sub> subreceptors and are associated with dyskinesias. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> subreceptors and has been associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. It is thought that postsynaptic D2 stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists, while presynaptic D2 stimulation confers neuroprotective effects. This semisynthetic ergot derivative exhibits potent agonist activity on dopamine D<sub>2</sub>- and D<sub>3</sub>-receptors. It also exhibits agonist activity on dopamine D<sub>4</sub>, D<sub>1</sub>, and D<sub>5</sub>, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, &alpha;<sub>2A</sub>-, &alpha;<sub>2B</sub>-, &alpha;<sub>2C</sub>-, &alpha;<sub>1A</sub>-, &alpha;<sub>1B</sub>-, and &alpha;<sub>1D</sub>-adrenergic receptors. Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity (e.g. movement, balance, walking), loss of activity may result in dystonia (acute muscle contraction), Parkinsonism (including symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and flattened affect), akathesia (inner restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long-term loss of dopaminergic activity), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonism. The tuberoinfundibular pathway of the brain originates in the hypothalamus and terminates in the pituitary gland. In this pathway, dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin. Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion. Pergolide also causes transient increases in somatotropin (growth hormone) secretion and decreases in luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations.']",['Drugs that bind to and activate dopamine receptors.

Urinary and fecal metabolites of 14C-cyromazine were isolated and identified by TLC, HPLC, and GC/MS.

With both systems the majority of the urinary radioactivity was determined to be in the form of unchanged parent compound. Unchanged parent compound in urine accounted for about 80% of the administered dose. Three metabolites were detected with each system and were presumed to be the same compounds. These metabolites accounted for 2.2-3.2%, 3.0-5.5%, and 4.6-5.3% of the administered dose, respectively, but no identification was made. Fecal material from a male rat given the same dose as the above female was found to contain little unchanged parent compound: <0.1% of the administered dose.

In the female liver residues were 13.2 ppm and 0.51 ppm and kidney residues 22.2 and 0.68 ppm of cyromazine and melamine, respectively. This study indicated that there was some conversion of cyromazine to melamine in vivo.', 'Urine from male and female monkeys (Macaca fasicicula) given single oral doses of 14C-cyromazine (uniformly triazine ring labeled) of 0.05 or 0.5 mg/kg bw by capsule was found to have the majority of the radioactivity present in the form of unchanged parent compound.

Unlabelled flutolanil (purity, 99.9% or 97.6%) was also used in preparation of the solutions. The animals received either a single dose of 20 mg/kg bw [14C]flutolanil; consecutive doses of 20 mg/kg bw per day of unlabelled flutolanil for 14 days followed by single dose of [14C]flutolanil on day 15; or a single dose of 1000 mg/kg [14C]flutolanil. After administration, urine was collected three times on day 1, then daily; and feces and cage wash were collected daily. After sample collection on day 7, the animals were killed, and blood and 12 tissue samples were obtained. The radioactivity in the samples was determined by liquid scintillation counting after appropriate processing. Volatile 14C production was not determined as an earlier study showed that <0.1% of the dose had been exhaled. The total recovery was acceptable at the lower dose but was <90% at the higher dose. Most of the radioactivity was excreted within 24 hr, approximately half the urinary excretion occurring within 12 hr, indicating relatively rapid absorption. The extent of absorption, as determined by urinary excretion, varied with dose and repeated dosing, indicating saturation of absorption by large doses. There was evidence of induction of flutolanil metabolism by repeated dosing. Similar results were found in the two sexes. The concentration and distribution of radioactivity in blood and tissues at 7 days was minimal, representing <0.2% of that administered to any animal, indicating no significant potential for bioaccumulation. The tissue concentrations varied considerably between animals in the same group. The only tissue in which consistent concentrations were found was the liver, in which the mean was about 10 times those in blood. The amount of radioactivity in the livers was higher in females in all groups than in males (2.4 +/- 1.1 versus 0.68 +/- 0.38 ug/g at 1000 mg/kg bw; 0.23 +/- 0.04 versus 0.12 +/- 0.01 ug/g after repeated doses).', 'In a study in which flutolanil was given in the diet to Sprague-Dawley rats for 4 weeks, analyses of brain, liver, blood, kidney and fat showed low concentrations in animals receiving >2000 ppm. The highest concentrations of residues were found in adipose tissue and liver. There was minimal retention of flutolanil. The lowest dose of 400 ppm was equal to 36 mg/kg bw per day in males and 41 mg/kg bw per day in females. Comparison of the results at 400 ppm with those at 20 mg/kg bw in /another study/ indicated that flutolanil that has no significant propensity to accumulate. The increase in residue concentration with increasing dose indicated that the saturation of absorption seen after administration by gavage does not occur after dietary intake.', 'An analysis of tissue samples from the study in rats given repeated doses showed that flutolanil was present only in fat and at low concentrations: 0.2 ppm at 2,000 ppm and 0.6 ppm at 10,000 ppm, which are similar to those found after a single dose. As the analytical method was only for the parent compound, any metabolites that might have contributed to the residues after a single dose would not have been detected. However, as the metabolites formed from flutolanil are relatively polar and are excreted primarily in urine, the findings from the study with repeated doses indicate that flutolanil has little if any potential to bioaccumulate.']",,

The total percentage dermal absorption was determined from the mean percentage recoveries of (14)C in the urine after correction for incomplete urinary excretion using the recovery figures obtained from im dose studies (49:17.7% recovery). The mean percentage dermal absorption of fenoxaprop-ethyl applied in acetone at a dose of 1.8 ug/sq cm was 32:6.8% and was significantly greater than that obtained at the same dose of fenoxaprop-ethyl applied in the Excel formulation (18:4.5%). Increasing the applied dose of fenoxaprop-ethyl had no effect on dermal absorption within the dose range 1.8 to 100 ug/sq cm; when doses of 10 and 100 ug/sq cm were applied in Excel, 20:6.7% and 21:4.5% was absorbed, respectively. Mass balance studies with the total percentage recovery in urine (im corrected) added to recovery from foam patches covering the dose site, and from gauze swabs moistened with soapy water taken of dosed skin 24 hr after treatment, demonstrated only 56:3.7%, 54:3.8%, 56:5.4% and 53:3.9% total recovery for the acetone 1.8 ug/sq cm and Excel 1.8, 10 and 100 ug/sq cm treatments, respectively. Significantly less residual (14)C activity was detected in the skin swabs taken for the acetone (8:3.5%) than for the Excel treatments (21:6.0%, 27:4.0% and 25:5.8% for the 1.8, 10 and 100 ug/sq cm dose rates, respectively). Comparative studies conducted at a dose rate of 1.4 ug/sq cm with automated in vitro dermal absorption procedure demonstrated no significantly different total percentage dermal absorption in dermatomed skin taken from the same rats tested in vivo at a dose rate of 1.8 ug/sq cm. There was no significant difference between the total percentage dermal absorption obtained for automated in vitro dermal absorption analysis of fresh rat skin (27:9.3%; n= 20) compared with that for rat skin frozen for 7 days in liquid nitrogen (25:7.6%; n= 19).']",,

Most pyrethroid metabolites are promptly excreted, at least in part, by the kidneys. /Pyrethroids/']","['The relative resistance of mammals to the pyrethroids is almost wholly attributable to their ability to hydrolyze the pyrethroids rapidly to their inactive acid and alcohol components, since direct injection into the mammalian CNS leads to a susceptibility similar to that seen in insects. Some additional resistance of homeothermic organisms can also be attributed to the negative temperature coefficient of action of the pyrethroids, which are thus less toxic at mammalian body temperatures, but the major effect is metabolic. Metabolic disposal of the pyrethroids is very rapid, which means that toxicity is high by the intravenous route, moderate by slower oral absorption, and often unmeasureably low by dermal absorption. /Pyrethroids/', 'Synthetic pyrethroids are generally metabolized in mammals through ester hydrolysis, oxidation, and conjugation, and there is no tendency to accumulate in tissues. In the environment, synthetic pyrethroids are fairly rapidly degraded in soil and in plants.

The apparent absence of TCDD metabolites in liver and fat suggests that once formed, the metabolites of TCDD are excreted readily. Thus, urinary and biliary elimination of TCDD depends on metabolism of the toxin. The more limited data for other compounds also suggest that this relationship may be true for 1,2,3,7,8-pentaCDD, 2,3,7,8-TBDD, 2,3,7,8-TCDF, 1,2,3,7,8-pentaCDF, 2,3,4,7,8-pentaCDF, and 3,3',4,4'-TCB."", '...The role of dietary fiber or Chlorella in the fecal excretion of PCDDs and PCDFs in rats /was investigated/.

Chlorella in the diet of rats also enhanced the fecal excretion of PCDDs from 0.8 to 5.6 and PCDFs from 0.9- to 11.1-fold above that of rats on a control diet. Dietary fiber, chlorophyll, and /or lipid in the Chlorella may be factors responsible for the enhanced fecal excretion of PCDDs and PCDFs observed in this study.

Dose excretion studies with cypermethrin (as a 1:1 cis/trans mixture) and alphacypermethrin (one of the two disasteroisomer pairs which constitute cis-cypermethrin) were out with, in each case, two volunteers per dose level. The studies included (a) single oral alphacypermethrin doses of 0.25 mg, 0.50 mg and 0.75 mg followed by repeated alphacypermethrin doses at the same levels, daily for five days, (b) repeated oral cypermethrin doses of 0.25 mg, 0.75 mg and 1.5 mg daily for five days, and (c) a single dermal application of 25 mg cypermethrin to the forearm. Urine was monitored for the free and conjugated 3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid before and after dosing. 2. Metabolism and rate of excretion of a single oral dose of alphacypermethrin was similar to that of cis cypermethrin, on average, 43% of the dose was excreted as the cyclopropanecarboxylic acid in the first 24 hr urine. There was no increase in urinary metabolite excretion when alphacypermethrin was administered as a repeated oral dose. Subjects excreted, on average, 49% of the dose as the cyclopropanecarboxylic acid in the subsequent 24 hr periods after dosing. 3. There was no increase in the urinary cyclopropanecarboxylic acid excretion when cypermethrin was administered as a repeated oral dose. Subjects excreted, on average, 72% of the trans isomer dose and 45% of the cis isomer dose respectively in the subsequent 24 hr periods after dosing. 4. Approximately 0.1% of the applied dermal dose of 25 mg cypermethrin was excreted within 72 hr as the urinary cyclopropanecarboxylic acid. No conclusions can be drawn from such urinary excretion data as to the concentration of cypermethrin and its metabolites in the skin or other organs, or the possibility of other routes of metabolism or excretion.', '/PYRETHROIDS/ READILY PENETRATE INSECT CUTICLE AS SHOWN BY TOPICAL LD50 TO PERIPLANETA (COCKROACH) ... /PYRETHROIDS/', 'WHEN RADIOACTIVE PYRETHROID IS ADMIN ORALLY TO MAMMALS, IT IS ABSORBED FROM INTESTINAL TRACT OF THE ANIMALS & DISTRIBUTED IN EVERY TISSUE EXAMINED.

When animals were exposed to aerosols of pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide being released into the air, little or none of the combination was systemically absorbed. /Pyrethrins/', 'Although limited absorption may account for the low toxicity of some pyrethroids, rapid biodegradation by mammalian liver enzymes (ester hydrolysis and oxidation) is probably the major factor responsible. Most pyrethroid metabolites are promptly excreted, at least in part, by the kidney. /Pyrethroids/']","['The metabolic pathways for the breakdown of the pyrethroids vary little between mammalian species but vary somewhat with structure. ... Essentially, pyrethrum and allethrin are broken down mainly by oxidation of the isobutenyl side chain of the acid moiety and of the unsaturated side chain of the alcohol moiety with ester hydrolysis playing and important part, whereas for the other pyrethroids ester hydrolysis predominates. /Pyrethrum and pyrethroids/', 'The relative resistance of mammals to the pyrethroids is almost wholly attributable to their ability to hydrolyze the pyrethroids rapidly to their inactive acid & alcohol components, since direct injection into the mammalian CNS leads to a susceptibility similar to that seen in insects. Some additional resistance of homeothermic organisms can also be attributed to the negative temperature coefficient of action of the pyrethroids, which are thus less toxic at mammalian body temperatures, but the major effect is metabolic. Metabolic disposal of the pyrethroids is very rapid, which means that toxicity is high by the iv route, moderate by slower oral absorption, & often unmeasureably low by dermal absorption. /Pyrethroids/', 'FASTEST BREAKDOWN IS SEEN WITH PRIMARY ALCOHOL ESTERS OF TRANS-SUBSTITUTED ACIDS SINCE THEY UNDERGO RAPID HYDROLYTIC & OXIDATIVE ATTACK. FOR ALL SECONDARY ALCOHOL ESTERS & FOR PRIMARY ALCOHOL CIS-SUBSTITUTED CYCLOPROPANECARBOXYLATES, OXIDATIVE ATTACK IS PREDOMINANT. /PYRETHROIDS/', 'Pyrethrins are reportedly inactivated in the GI tract following ingestion. In animals, pyrethrins are rapidly metabolized to water soluble, inactive compounds. /Pyrethrins/', 'Synthetic pyrethroids are generally metabolized in mammals through ester hydrolysis, oxidation, and conjugation, and there is no tendency to accumulate in tissues. In the environment, synthetic pyrethroids are fairly rapidly degraded in soil and in plants.
