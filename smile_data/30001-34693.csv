Approximately 40% of the drug in the plasma is present as daunorubicinol within 30 minutes and 60% in 4 hours after a dose of nonencapsulated daunorubicin.', ""Daunorubicinol has been detected only in low concentrations in the plasma following iv administration of daunorubicin citrate liposomal injection. In patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma receiving iv administration of liposomal daunorubicin doses of 40 mg/sq m, the AUC of daunorubicinol represented only 2% of the total daunorubicin AUC.

The mean half-life of elimination of liposomal daunorubicin has been reported to be 22.1 h in pharmacokinetic studies and 31.5 h in official FDA labeling.', 'Following rapid iv administration of conventional daunorubicin hydrochloride injection, total plasma concentrations of daunorubicin and its metabolites decline in a triphasic manner, and plasma concentrations of unchanged daunorubicin decline in a biphasic manner.', 'The plasma half-life of nonencapsulated daunorubicin averages 45 minutes in the initial phase and 18.5 hours in the terminal phase. By 1 hour after administration of nonencapsulated daunorubicin, the predominant form of the drug in plasma is the active metabolite daunorubicinol, which has an average terminal plasma half-life of 26.7 hours.', 'The apparent elimination half-life of DaunoXome (daunorubicin citrate liposome injection) is 4.4 hours, far shorter than that of daunorubicin, and probably represents a distribution half-life.']"

In four postmenopausal women (age 54-63 years, weight 67-93 kg) the mean estradiol level 24 hr postapplication over the 9 day study period was 53 pg/mL.

The mean estradiol/estrone ratio also rose significantly (p < 0.04) from a baseline value of 0.2 up to 0.8.', 'It appears that sunscreen agents are absorbed by the intact epidermis to varying degrees. /Sunscreens/', 'Sunscreen skin penetration and safety assessment should be considered together in order to ensure that in vitro cytotoxicity studies examine relevant doses of these organic chemical UV filters to which viable epidermal cells are realistically exposed. In this study, /investigators/ sought to determine whether sufficient topically applied sunscreens penetrated into human viable epidermis to put the local keratinocyte cell populations at risk of toxicity. The penetration and retention of five commonly used sunscreen agents (avobenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, oxybenzone and padimate O) in human skin was evaluated after application in mineral oil to isolated human epidermal membranes. Sunscreen concentration-human keratinocyte culture response curves were then defined using changes in cell morphology and proliferation (DNA synthesis using radiolabelled thymidine uptake studies) as evidence of sunscreens causing toxicity. Following 24 hr of human epidermal exposure to sunscreens, detectable amounts of all sunscreens were present in the stratum corneum and viable epidermis, with epidermal penetration most evident with oxybenzone. The concentrations of each sunscreen found in human viable epidermis after topical application, adjusting for skin partitioning and binding effects, were at least 5-fold lower, based on levels detected in viable epidermal cells, than those appearing to cause toxicity in cultured human keratinocytes. It is concluded that the human viable epidermal levels of sunscreens are too low to cause any significant toxicity to the underlying human keratinocytes.', ""Researchers in Europe analyzed samples of human milk for the presence of sunscreens and other chemicals with possible endocrine activity. Mothers were asked about their use of sunscreens and cosmetics that contained sunscreen ingredients (benzophenone 2, benzophenone 3, 3-benzylidene camphor, 4-MBC, OMC, homosalate, octocrylene, and octyl-dimethyl PABA). Responding to questionnaires, 78.8% of the women reported using products that contained sunscreens; 76.5% of human milk samples contained these chemicals. There was a high correlation reported between mothers' use of these chemicals and their concentrations in human milk. The authors concluded that except for lipsticks (the ingestion of which is probably important), their results agree with studies in animals and humans showing dermal absorption of sunscreens. Given that some of these chemicals have endocrine activity in animals, the authors suggested that exposure could be lessened if mothers abstained from using these products during their children's sensitive life stages."", ""Information on the cutaneous absorption, distribution, and elimination of most topically applied sunscreen agents is limited. Solvents used in sunscreen products affect the stability and binding of the drug to the skin; in general, alcoholic solvents allow for the most rapid and deepest epidermal penetration of sunscreens. It appears that sunscreen agents are absorbed by the intact epidermis to varying degrees. PABA reportedly diffuses into the stratum corneum, reaching maximum concentrations there 2 hours following application, but apparently does not penetrate deeper layers of the skin to a substantial extent. Homosalate's penetration also appears to be limited to the stratum corneum. One study in animals indicated that PABA may penetrate the skin to a greater extent than does padimate A. Although some studies have shown that substantive concentrations of PABA remain on the skin after washing, other studies have failed to confirm this. One study showed that PABA esters were removed from the skin less readily than was PABA or other chemical sunscreens. /PABA/""]",['No pharmacokinetic data available.'],['No pharmacokinetic data available.']

The metabolites were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. NADPH and cumene-hydroperoxide (CHP) were used as cofactors. Similar metabolic profiles were seen in the presence of NADPH or cumene-hydroperoxide with induced microsomes for benzo(a)pyrene and 6-fluorobenzo(a)pyrene; dihydrodiols, phenols and quinones were produced by both compounds with NADPH, while only quinones were produced with cumene-hydroperoxide. With uninduced microsomes and cumene-hydroperoxide, metabolism of benzo(a)pyrene and 6-fluorobenzo(a)pyrene produced the same benzo(a)pyrene quinones. Uninduced microsomes in the presence of NADPH produced dihydrodiols, phenols and quinones from benzo(a)pyrene, while only quinones were produced from 6-fluorobenzo(a)pyrene. 6-chlorobenzo(a)pyrene and 6-bromobenzo(a)pyrene produced metabolites only with induced nicrosomes and NADPH. The manganic oxidation of benzo(a)pyrene and 6-fluorobenzo(a)pyrene, and the reaction of benzo(a)pyrene and 6-fluorobenzo(a)pyrene radical cation perchlorates with water were investigated. Results indicated that metabolic formation of benzo(a)pyrene quinones from benzo(a)pyrene and 6-fluorobenzo(a)pyrene can only derive from their intermediate radical cation. /It was/ concluded that the benzo(a)pyrene and 6-fluorobenzo(a)pyrene quinones arise from an initial one electron oxidation of benzo(a)pyrene to its radical cation.']",

Bromocriptine has also been used off-label to treat restless legs syndrome and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.']","['Bromocriptine stimulates centrally-located dopaminergic receptors resulting in a number of pharmacologic effects. Five dopamine receptor types from two dopaminergic subfamilies have been identified. The dopaminergic D1 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>5</sub> subreceptors, which are associated with dyskinesias. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> subreceptors, which are associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. It is thought that postsynaptic D<sub>2</sub> stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists, while presynaptic D<sub>2</sub> stimulation confers neuroprotective effects. This semisynthetic ergot derivative exhibits potent agonist activity on dopamine D<sub>2</sub>-receptors. It also exhibits agonist activity (in order of decreasing binding affinity) on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>1D</sub>, dopamine D<sub>3</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, antagonist activity on &alpha;<sub>2A</sub>-adrenergic, &alpha;<sub>2C</sub>, &alpha;<sub>2B</sub>, and dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptors, partial agonist activity at receptor 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>, and inactivates dopamine D<sub>4</sub> and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors. Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity (e.g. movement, balance, walking), loss of activity may result in dystonia (acute muscle contraction), Parkinsonism (including symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and flattened affect), akathesia (inner restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long-term loss of dopaminergic activity), and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonism. The tuberoinfundibular pathway of the brain originates in the hypothalamus and terminates in the pituitary gland. In this pathway, dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin. Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion making bromocriptine an effective agent for treating disorders associated with hypersecretion of prolactin. Pulmonary fibrosis may be associated bromocriptine’s agonist activity at 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors.']","['Agents used in the treatment of Parkinson&apos;s disease.

On days 1 and 4, blood and urine samples were collected for analysis of fenitrothion and its major metabolites, as well as plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase activities, and biochemistry and hematology examination. Pharmacokinetic parameters could only be determined at the higher dosage, as there were insufficient measurable fenitrothion blood levels at the lower dosage and the fenitrooxone metabolite could not be measured. There was a wide range of interindividual variability in blood levels, with peak levels achieved between 1 and 4 hr and a half-life for fenitrothion of 0.8-4.5 hr. Although based on the half-life, steady-state levels should have been achieved; the area under the curve (AUC)(0-12 hr) to AUC(0-(infinity) )ratio of 1:3 suggested accumulation of fenitrothion.

Dermal exposure to these compounds can result in localised or systemic toxicity including skin sensitisation and irritancy, reproductive, developmental and hematological effects. It has previously been shown that skin has the capacity for local metabolism of applied chemicals. Therefore, there is a requirement to consider metabolism during dermal absorption of these compounds in risk assessment for humans. Cytosolic fractions were prepared from rat liver, and whole and dermatomed skin by differential centrifugation. Rat skin cytosolic fractions were also prepared following multiple dermal exposure to dexamethasone, ethanol or 2-butoxyethanol (2-BE). The rate of ethanol, 2-ethoxyethanol (2-EE), ethylene glycol, 2-phenoxyethanol (2-PE) and 2-BE conversion to alkoxyacetic acid by ADH/ALDH in these fractions was continuously monitored by UV spectrophotometry via the conversion of NAD+ to NADH at 340 nm. Rates of ADH oxidation by rat liver cytosol were greatest for ethanol followed by 2-EE >ethylene glycol >2-PE >2-BE. However, the order of metabolism changed to 2-BE >2-PE >ethylene glycol >2-EE >ethanol using whole and dermatomed rat skin cytosolic fractions, with approximately twice the specific activity in dermatomed skin cytosol relative to whole rat skin. This suggests that ADH and ALDH are localised in the epidermis that constitutes more of the protein in dermatomed skin than whole skin cytosol. Inhibition of ADH oxidation in rat liver cytosol by pyrazole was greatest for ethanol followed by 2-EE >ethylene glycol >2-PE >2-BE, but it only inhibited ethanol metabolism by 40% in skin cytosol. Disulfiram completely inhibited alcohol and glycol ether metabolism in the liver and skin cytosolic fractions. Although ADH1, ADH2 and ADH3 are expressed at the protein level in rat liver, only ADH1 and ADH2 are selectively inhibited by pyrazole and they constitute the predominant isoforms that metabolise short-chain alcohols in preference to intermediate chain-length alcohols. However, ADH1, ADH3 and ADH4 predominate in rat skin, demonstrate different sensitivities to pyrazole, and are responsible for metabolising glycol ethers. ALDH1 is the predominant isoform in rat liver and skin cytosolic fractions that is selectively inhibited by disulfiram and responds to the amount of aldehyde formed by the ADH isoforms expressed in these tissues. Thus, the different affinity of ADH and ALDH for alcohols and glycol ethers of different carbon-chain length may reflect the relative isoform expression in rat liver and skin. Following multiple topical exposure, ethanol metabolism increased the most following ethanol treatment, and 2-BE metabolism increased the most following 2-BE treatment. Ethanol and 2-BE may induce specific ADH and ALDH isoforms that preferentially metabolise short-chain alcohols (i.e. ADH1, ALDH1) and longer chain alcohols (i.e. ADH3, ADH4, ALDH1), respectively. Treatment with a general inducing agent such as dexamethasone enhanced ethanol and 2-BE metabolism suggesting induction of multiple ADH isoforms.', 'Studies were conducted... to evaluate the in vitro hemolytic potential of / ethylene glycol phenyl ether/ EGPE and its major metabolite using rabbit red blood cells (RBC).

A comparison of levels of radioactivity in blood or plasma, reached after intramuscular or intravenous administration, indicated that the drug was completely absorbed from the site of intramuscular injection within 10-15 min in all three species. Within 1-5 min after intramuscular or intravenous administration, the 21-phosphate ester was completely hydrolyzed to triamcinolone acetonide, which was present in the blood. The radioactivity was eliminated rapidly (t1/2 = 1-2 hr) from plasma (dogs, monkeys, and rats) and tissues (rats) after intramuscular or intravenous administration. In the three species, the major route of excretion was via the bile; however, the ratio of biliary to urinary excretion among the species varied considerably (from 1.5 to 15). In rats, excretion of radioactivity as expired carbon dioxide accounted for only 2-3 percent of the dose. 6beta-Hydroxytriamcinolone acetonide was the major metabolite in urine of the three species. Hydrolytic cleavage of the acetonide group did not appear to be significant.', 'Six healthy male subjects each received a single 100 uCi (approximately 800 ug) oral dose of (14)C-triamcinolone acetonide. Plasma, urine, and fecal samples were collected at selected times and analyzed for triamcinolone acetonide and (14)C-derived radioactivity. Plasma protein binding of triamcinolone acetonide was also determined. Metabolite profiling and identification were carried out in plasma and excreta. Principle metabolites were assessed for activity with in vitro anti-inflammatory models. (14)C-triamcinolone acetonide was found to be systemically absorbed following oral administration. The presystemic metabolism and clearance of triamcinolone acetonide were extensive, with only a small fraction of the total plasma radioactivity being made up of triamcinolone acetonide. Little to no parent compound was detected in the plasma 24 hours after administration. Most of the urinary and fecally (14)C-derived radioactivity was also excreted within 24 and 72 hours postdose, respectively. Mean plasma protein binding of triamcinolone acetonide was constant, predictable, and a relatively low 68% over a 24-fold range of plasma concentrations. Three principle metabolites of triamcinolone acetonide were profiled in plasma, urine, and feces. These metabolites were identified as 6 beta-hydroxy triamcinolone, 21-carboxylic acid triamcinolone acetonide, and 6 beta-hydroxy-21-oic triamcinolone acetonide. All three metabolites failed to show any concentration-dependent effects in anti-inflammatory models evaluating IL-5-sustained eosinophil viability and IgE-induced basophil histamine release. /Triamcinolone acetonide/', 'Triamcinolone acetonide is a glucocorticoid administered by oral inhalation in the management of asthma. With oral inhalation of glucocorticoids, systemic absorption can come from oropharyngeal, gastrointestinal, or airway deposition of the drug. The objectives of this study were to determine the absolute bioavailability of triamcinolone acetonide following inhalation administration and to delineate the airway contribution of triamcinolone acetonide absorption relative to the absolute bioavailability. All subjects received a 5-minute 400 mcg intravenous infusion of triamcinolone acetonide and a single 800 mcg dose of inhaled triamcinolone acetonide with and without oral charcoal administration in a randomized three-way crossover fashion. The oral charcoal allowed for isolating the pulmonary component of absorption by adsorbing the oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal deposited drug. The mean (+/- SD) absolute bioavailability value for inhaled triamcinolone acetonide was 25% (8.75%). Delineation of the airway contribution of triamcinolone acetonide absorption showed that 10.4% of an inhaled dose is absorbed as triamcinolone acetonide from the lungs. Mean (+/- SD) total body clearance was rapid at 0.57 (0.12) L/hr/kg. The mean (+/- SD) apparent volume of distribution following the intravenous dose was a low 1.96 (0.31) L/kg.

TCVG was a potent mutagen in presence of rat kidney particulate fractions containing high concentrations of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and dipeptidases. Purified tetra was not mutagenic without exogenous metabolic activation or under conditions favoring oxidative metabolism. Preincubation of tetra with purified rat liver glutathione (GSH) S-transferases in presence of GSH and rat kidney fractions resulted in a time-dependent formation of TCVG as determined by (HPLC) analysis and in an unequivocal mutagenic response in the Ames test. Experiments with tetra in the isolated perfused rat liver demonstrated TCVG formation and its excretion with the bile; bile collected after the addition of tetra to the isolated perfused liver was unequivocally mutagenic in bacteria in the presence of kidney particulate fractions. The mutagenicity was reduced in all cases by the GGT inhibitor serine borate or the beta-lyase inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid. These results support the suggestion that cleavage of the GSH S conjugate formed from tetra by the enzymes of the mercapturic acid pathway and by beta-lyase may be involved in the nephrocarcinogenic effects of this haloalkene in rats.', 'This article reports on the development of a ""harmonized"" PBPK model for the toxicokinetics of perchloroethylene (tetrachloroethylene or perc) in mice, rats, and humans that includes both oxidation and glutathione (GSH) conjugation of perc, the internal kinetics of the oxidative metabolite trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and the urinary excretion kinetics of the GSH conjugation metabolites N-Acetylated trichlorovinyl cysteine and dichloroacetic acid. The model utilizes a wider range of in vitro and in vivo data than any previous analysis alone, with in vitro data used for initial, or ""baseline,"" parameter estimates, and in vivo datasets separated into those used for ""calibration"" and those used for ""evaluation."" Parameter calibration utilizes a limited Bayesian analysis involving flat priors and making inferences only using posterior modes obtained via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). As expected, the major route of elimination of absorbed perc is predicted to be exhalation as parent compound, with metabolism accounting for less than 20% of intake except in the case of mice exposed orally, in which metabolism is predicted to be slightly over 50% at lower exposures. In all three species, the concentration of perc in blood, the extent of perc oxidation, and the amount of TCA production is well-estimated, with residual uncertainties of approximately 2-fold. However, the resulting range of estimates for the amount of GSH conjugation is quite wide in humans (approximately 3000-fold) and mice (approximately 60-fold). While even high-end estimates of GSH conjugation in mice are lower than estimates of oxidation, in humans the estimated rates range from much lower to much higher than rates for perc oxidation. It is unclear to what extent this range reflects uncertainty, variability, or a combination. Importantly, by separating total perc metabolism into separate oxidative and conjugative pathways, an approach also recommended in a recent National Research Council review, this analysis reconciles the disparity between those previously published PBPK models that concluded low perc metabolism in humans and those that predicted high perc metabolism in humans. In essence, both conclusions are consistent with the data if augmented with some additional qualifications: in humans, oxidative metabolism is low, while GSH conjugation metabolism may be high or low, with uncertainty and/or interindividual variability spanning three orders of magnitude. More direct data on the internal kinetics of perc GSH conjugation, such as trichlorovinyl glutathione or tricholorvinyl cysteine in blood and/or tissues, would be needed to better characterize the uncertainty and variability in GSH conjugation in humans.', 'Tetrachloroethylene is a volatile, lipophilic small molecule that is rapidly and extensively absorbed after inhalation and oral exposure. It can also be rapidly absorbed through the skin, but dermal absorption appears to be a less important route of exposure. In humans, inhalation exposure to tetrachloroethylene typically results, within a few hours of exposure, in a pseudoequilibrium between inspired air and blood although there can be substantial interindividual differences in absorption behavior. After oral dosing in animals, peak blood tetrachloroethylene concentrations are typically reached within 15-30 min, and systemic bioavailability is typically greater than 80%; once absorbed, tetrachloroethylene is rapidly distributed throughout the body, and well-perfused tissues reach a pseudoequilibrium with blood within a few minutes.', 'Because of its lipophilicity, the highest concentrations of tetrachloroethylene are found in adipose tissue. In humans, the fat-to-blood concentration ratio has been estimated to be as high as 90:1. Relatively high concentrations are also observed in the liver and brain. On the basis of animal studies and sparse human data, the brain concentration of tetrachloroethylene is 4-8 times the blood concentration.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for Tetrachloroethylene (32 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['Despite the low overall metabolism of tetrachloroethylene compared with other chlorinated solvents, its metabolism has been studied extensively in both human volunteers and laboratory animals, using both in vivo and in vitro techniques. The studies showed that many metabolites are produced, including some known to be cytotoxic, mutagenic or both. Tetrachloroethylene metabolism can be viewed as having three pathways. The first is cytochrome P-450-mediated (CYP-mediated) oxidation. The second and third share a starting point: direct conjugation with glutathione to S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)glutathione (TCVG) and then further processing to S-(1,2,2-trichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (TCVC). For the second pathway, beta-lyase catalyzes the formation of reactive products from TCVC. The third pathway is independent of beta-lyase: TCVC is processed further by acetylation and sulfoxidation reactions. Genotoxic and cytotoxic metabolites are formed by each of these pathways. The predominant metabolic pathway is the CYP path, followed by the beta-lyase pathway and then the beta-lyase independent pathway. The TCVC derivatives are toxicologically important but quantitatively minor metabolites.', 'Trichloroethylene (TRI) and tetrachloroethylene (TETRA) are solvents that have been widely used in a variety of industries, and both are widespread environmental contaminants. ...

Toxicokinetic time courses and empirical analyses of classical toxicokinetic parameters were compared with those reported in previous human volunteer studies, most of which involved exposures that were at least 10 fold higher. Qualitatively, TRI and TETRA toxicokinetics were consistent with previous human studies. Quantitatively, alveolar retention and clearance by exhalation were similar to those found previously but blood and urine data suggest a number of possible toxicokinetic differences. For TRI, data from the current study support lower apparent blood-air partition coefficients, greater apparent metabolic clearance, less TCA production, and greater glucuronidation of TCOH as compared to previous studies. For TETRA, the current data suggest TCA formation that is similar or slightly lower than that of previous studies.

The ability of EM to bind to cytoplasmic estrogen receptors was tested by inhibition of the binding of 3H-E2 to rat uterine cytosol at 18 degrees C and 30 degrees C. At both temperatures an inhibition curve was observed in the presence of a large excess of drug, suggesting that the latter has a very weak binding affinity (100,000 times lower than E2). Incubation of uterine cytosol with increasing amounts of 3H-E2 in the presence and absence of an excess of EM indicated that the drug interacted with the receptors at the same sites as E2 (competitive inhibition). Preincubation of uterine cytosol at 18 degrees C with EM induced a progressive reduction of 3H-E2 binding capacity. This reduction also occurred, although to a lesser extent, when long-term incubation of the cytosol with EM was performed in the presence of labelled E2 from the start. The process was faster at 18 degrees C than at 4 degrees C and did not occur with EM preincubated in homogenization buffer. Exchange assays by 3H-E2 of uterine receptors preincubated with labelled E2 and excess EM indicated that the drug-induced inhibition of binding capacity was reversible and produced no apparent alteration of the receptors. Furthermore, the rate of exchange was similar to that observed with receptors previously filled with unlabelled E2. In 9 ""receptor-positive"" cytosols from human breast cancers, time-course study of the binding of 3H-E2 in the presence of excess of EM yielded similar results as those obtained with rat uterine cytosol. These results show that EM has a very low binding affinity for the extrogen receptors and that it is metabolized into one or several compounds of higher binding affinity. They suggest that EM is probably not significantly concentrated by the estrogen target tissues such as mammary cancers. Therefore, the drug is unlikely to be very valuable in the treatment of breast cancer through a specific mechanism involving concentration by the estrogen receptors.']",,

However, approximately half of the dose is eliminated from the body unchanged. Two electron reduction yields doxorubicinol, a secondary alcohol. This pathway is considered the primary metabolic pathway. The one electron reduction is facilitated by several oxidoreductases to form a doxirubicin-semiquinone radical.  These enzymes include mitochondrial and cystolic NADPH dehydrogenates, xanthine oxidase, and nitric oxide synthases. Deglycosidation is a minor metabolic pathway (1-2% of the dose undergoes this pathway). The resultant metabolites are deoxyaglycone or hydroxyaglycone formed via reduction or hydrolysis respectively. Enzymes that may be involved with this pathway include xanthine oxidase, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, and cytosolic NADPH dehydrogenase.', 'Nonencapsulated doxorubicin is metabolized by NADPH-dependent aldoketoreductases to the hydrophilic 13-hydroxyl metabolite doxorubicinol, which exhibits antineoplastic activity and is the major metabolite; these reductases are present in most if not all cells, but particularly in erythrocytes, liver, and kidney. Although not clearly established, doxorubicinol also appears to be the moiety responsible for the cardiotoxic effects of the drug. Undetectable or low plasma concentrations (ie, 0.8-26.2 ng/mL) of doxorubicinol have been reported following iv administration of a single 10- to 50-mg/sq m dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride as a PEG-stabilized liposomal injection; it remains to be established whether such liposomally encapsulated anthracyclines are less cardiotoxic than conventional (nonencapsulated) drug, and the usual precautions for unencapsulated drug currently also should be observed for the liposomal preparation. Substantially reduced or absent plasma concentrations of the usual major metabolite of doxorubicin observed with the PEG-stabilized liposomal injection suggests that either the drug is not released appreciably from the liposomes as they circulate or that some doxorubicin may be released but that the rate of doxorubicinol elimination greatly exceeds the release rate; doxorubicin hydrochloride encapsulated in liposomes that have not been PEG-stabilized is metabolized to doxorubicinol.', 'Other metabolites, which are therapeutically inactive, include the poorly water-soluble aglycones, doxorubicinone (adriamycinone) and 7-deoxydoxorubicinone (17-deoxyadriamycinone), and conjugates. The aglycones are formed in microsomes by NADPH-dependent, cytochrome reductase-mediated cleavage of the amino sugar moiety. The enzymatic reduction of doxorubicin to 7-deoxyaglycones is important to the cytotoxic effect of the drug since it results in hydroxyl radicals that cause extensive cell damage and death. With nonencapsulated doxorubicin, more than 20% of the total drug in plasma is present as metabolites as soon as 5 minutes after a dose, 70% in 30 minutes, 75% in 4 hours, and 90% in 24 hours.', '...

In the guinea pig, the drug was metabolized by O-demethylation to give 4-hydroxyamphetamine, which was excreted free (4% dose) and conjugated (73%). No other metabolite was detected. The rat metabolizes the drug both by O-dealkylation and by side-chain oxidation, the products being 4-hydroxyamphetamine (5% of dose free and 60% conjugated) and 1-(4'-methoxyphenyl)propan-2-one oxime (5% dose, free and conjugated).

None of the six compounds examined was N-dealkylated to any extent.  The only metabolites produced from AM, NEA and NBA were the corresponding ring 4-hydroxylated compounds, and the rates of formation were low.  All ring 4-methoxylated substrates were efficiently O-demethylated by CYP2D6 to their corresponding phenols. The size of the N-alkyl group influenced the rates of formation of these phenolamines. In contrast to reported findings with 2- and 3-methoxyamphetamines, none of the 4-methoxyamphetamines was ring-oxidized in the CYP2D6 enzyme system to 2- or 3-hydroxy-4-methoxyamphetamines or to dihydroxyamphetamines.', 'Metabolites of p-methoxyamphetamine in the urine of dogs and monkeys were separated by gas-liquid chromatography as their trifluoroacetyl derivatives, and identified by comparison of the chromatographic and mass spectrometric behavior of these derivatives with those of authentic synthetic compounds.

The plasma peak level was 5 times higher, and the area under curve (AUC) was 10 times higher, in (3)H-FX-administered than (3)H-NIV-administered mice. These findings clearly demonstrate that FX is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract more rapidly and efficiently than NIV. The HPLC profile of radioactivity of acetonitrile extracts of urine and feces indicated that FX is rapidly metabolized to NIV after being absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In vitro incubation of tissue homogenates with (3)H-FX demonstrated that the liver and kidney are the organs responsible for the FX-to-NIV conversion. Thus this study demonstrated that the higher oral toxicity of FX than NIV that has been observed in mice and rats is due to the efficient absorption of FX than NIV from the gastrointestinal tract, followed by its rapid conversion to NIV by the liver and kidney.']","['There is evidence of major species-dependent differences in the extent of de-epoxidation of nivalenol in non-ruminants, which may occur in the lower parts of the gastrointestinal tract in some species.

The cytotoxic effects was determined by using the 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay assessing DNA-synthesis. The toxicity of NIV and DON expressed as the concentration inhibiting 50% of the DNA synthesis (IC(50)), was occurring at similar micromolar concentrations (1.19+/-0.06 and 1.50+/-0.34 uM). The toxicity of fusarenon X (4-acetyl NIV) in the assay was similar to the toxicity of NIV, and the toxicity of 15-AcDON was equal to the toxicity of DON. 3-AcDON was less toxic than DON and 15-AcDON. The IC(50) value for de-epoxy DON was 54 times higher in the assay than the IC(50) for DON, while the IC(50) of de-epoxy NIV was 55 times higher than the IC(50) for NIV.

Results of dermal application to guinea pigs demonstrated a strong correlation between the applied dermal dose and the urinary residue excretion over the dosage range tested. As the dosage was increased the urinary excretion of residues was also increased. Residue levels were also determined to estimate skin contamination after sampling by filter pads attached to the clothing and arms of agricultural sprayers. Residues in the workers urine before and after exposure were also determined.

Similar rapid elimination of (14)C-propamocarb hydrochloride by female rats was also observed following oral administration of 0.5 mg (14)C-propamocarb hydrochloride/kg b.w./day for 21 days. During the 21-day dosing period, an average of 83% and 3.2% of the daily administered dose was recovered respectively in the urine and the feces. At sacrifice, 24 hours after acute or subacute oral dosing, total (14)C residues detected in the 19 tissues analyzed including, among others liver, kidney, lung, spleen, heart, adipose tissue, skin and skeletal muscle (but excluding the alimentary tract) accounted for 1.7% of the single dose and approximately 0.3% of the total dose given over a 21 day dosing period (equivalent to approximately 7% of the last daily dose). Female rats with ""Acute biliary - and urethra fistula"" treated with a single intraduodenal dose of 0.5 mg/kg b.w. of (14)C-propamocarb hydrochloride eliminated 81% of the administered radio-activity in the urine as early as six hours after dosing.

Rescinnamine inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex and general vasoconstriction, both of which lead to increases vascular resistance. By inhibiting angiotensin II, aldosterone reabsorption is decreased as well as vasoconstriction. This combined effect serves to decrease blood pressure.']",,,,

BTBPE is a low-volume brominated flame retardant used in resins or plastics, and toxicity data in peer-reviewed journals is extremely limited. BTBPE was fairly insoluble in lipophilic solutions, which made dose preparation difficult. The great majority of (14)C (>94%) was excreted in the feces of both groups of rats at 72 hr, and tissue retention was minimal. Lipophilic tissues contained the highest concentrations of BTBPE, e.g. thymus, adipose tissue, adrenals, lung, and skin. Metabolites were excreted in the urine, bile and feces, but at a very low level. Fecal metabolites were characterized as monohydroxylated, monohydroxylated with debromination, dihydroxylated/debrominated on a single aromatic ring, monohydroxylated on each aromatic ring with accompanying debromination, and cleavage on either side of the ether linkage to yield tribromophenol and tribromophenoxyethanol...']",

Changes in human milk content of free amino acids (FAAs) was determined at colostrum, 1 month, and 3 months of lactation in 16 healthy lactating women after delivery of full-term infants. Milk was collected at the end of each feeding (hindmilk) during 24 hours. Glutamic acid and taurine were the most abundant FAAs at colostrum. Although taurine remained stable throughout lactation, glutamic acid (the prevalent FAA) and glutamine increased approximately 2.5 and 20 times, respectively, with progressing lactation representing more than 50% of total FAA at 3 months. The content of essential FAA was also stable, so the change in total FAA content was almost entirely due to the changes in glutamic acid and glutamine. Breast-fed infants are supplied with progressively increasing amounts of glutamine and glutamic acid throughout lactation. The increasing intake of glutamic acid and glutamine could benefit breast-fed infants with molecules that are likely to protect the enteral mucosa and act as neurotransmitters and as a source of nitrogen.', 'In this report, (13)N -labeled L-glutamine and L-glutamic acid was synthesized by an enzymatic method ... . Organ distribution studies and whole body scans in mongrel dogs demonstrated low myocardial uptake of glutamine and glutamic acid and that the liver demonstrated a greater uptake of glutamine than glutamic acid or ammonia.', 'The measurement of the intestinal metabolism of the nitrogen moiety of glutamic acid has been investigated by oral ingestion of l-[(15)N]glutamic acid and sampling of arterialized blood. Measurements have been made in six normal adults weighing an average of 72.8 kg ingesting 100 mg of l-[(15)N]glutamic acid after an overnight fast. Measurement of the enrichment of arterial glutamic acid, glutamine and alanine was by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Isotopic enrichment of the amino acids was followed for 150 min after the ingestion of the amino acid. Arterialized venous blood amino acid concentrations, measured by HPLC, demonstrated no significant changes during the course of the experiment. From the observed appearance of label in arterialized glutamic acid, alanine and glutamine, little luminal glutamic acid reaches the extracellular pool.

Glutamate is the main excitatory and GABA the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian cortex. Changes in glutamate and GABA metabolism may play important roles in the control of cortical excitability. Glutamate is the metabolic precursor of GABA, which can be recycled through the tricarboxylic acid cycle to synthesize glutamate. GABA synthesis is unique among neurotransmitters, having two separate isoforms of the rate-controlling enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase. The need for two separate genes on two chromosomes to control GABA synthesis is unexplained. Two metabolites of GABA are present in uniquely high concentrations in the human brain. Homocarnosine and pyrrolidinone have a major impact on GABA metabolism in the human brain. Both of these GABA metabolites have anticonvulsant properties and can have a major impact on cortical excitability. /Glutamate, GABA/', 'The measurement of the intestinal metabolism of the nitrogen moiety of glutamic acid has been investigated by oral ingestion of l-[(15)N]glutamic acid and sampling of arterialized blood.

Subsequently, the animals were dosed with the 35S labelled compound and studied for up to 72 hours for excretion and distribution patterns of the color. Both species showed limited absorption of the compound with the major route of excretion being via the feces.

Finally, significant retention in the washed intestines of rat was observed, probably due to adhesion to the intestinal wall.', 'Cresidinesulfonic acid was found to be the major metabolite of Allura Red in the urine of these two species, whereas the parent compound was not measurable. In addition, two other unidentifiable metabolites were found in the urine of the rats. In the rat fecal extracts, cresidinesulfonic acid was a major metabolite along with two unknowns and the parent compound. The dog fecal sample revealed an identical metabolite pattern as seen in the rat, and in addition, a third unknown was discovered. One of the urinary unknowns demonstrated an Rf value which was identical to that of the one of the fecal unknowns suggesting that they were one and the same. The other unknowns exhibited distinctive Rf values which indicated that these metabolites were different. It has been postulated that azo reduction by gut flora of the dye will yield the two components of the parent compound: 2-methoxy-5-methyl-aniline-4-sulfonic acid (cresidine-4-sulfonic acid) and 1-amino-2-naphthol-6-sulfonic acid.

They are becoming contaminants of emerging concern since their residues are frequently detected in multiple environmental matrices and their toxicological implications are increasingly reported. We herein investigated the antiandrogenic activities of eight BUVSs prior to and after human CYP3A4-mediated metabolic activation/deactivation by the two-hybrid recombinant human androgen receptor yeast bioassay and the in vitro metabolism assay. More potent antiandrogenic activity was observed for the metabolized UV-328 in comparison with UV-328 at 0.25 uM ((40.73 +/- 4.90)% vs. (17.12 +/- 3.00)%), showing a significant metabolic activation. In contrast, the metabolized UV-P at 0.25 uM resulted in a decreased antiandrogenic activity rate from (16.08 +/- 0.95)% to (6.91 +/- 2.64)%, indicating a metabolic deactivation. Three mono-hydroxylated (OH) and three di-OH metabolites of UV-328 were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS), which were not reported previously. We further surmised that the hydroxylation of UV-328 occurs mainly at the alicyclic hydrocarbon atoms based on the in silico prediction of the lowest activation energies of hydrogen abstraction from C-H bond. Our results for the first time relate antiandrogenic activity to human CYP3A4 enzyme-mediated hydroxylated metabolites of BUVSs. The biotransformation through hydroxylation should be fully considered during the health risk assessment of structurally similar analogs of BUVSs and other emerging contaminants.']",

Carcasses were frozen and radioactivity determined later in blood, spleen, liver, kidneys, bone marrow, and three sections of gastrointestinal tract. Carcasses, after removal of skin and feet were homogenized and radioactivity determined. While this study has marked deficiencies, it demonstrates that DADMAC is poorly absorbed. No change in clinical signs was observed in the treated animals. There was a slight weight loss in the study. The primary route of excretion for 14-C derived from DADMAC monomer was feces. ...The tissue levels for monomer were very low at each time point and there was no accumulation in any organ. The highest concentration of any organ was liver at 24 hours which had 0.0034% of the administered radioactivity. DADMAC was poorly absorbed. Of the tissues studied, the liver was found to have the largest percent uptake. The principal route of excretion was via the feces followed by the urinary pathway with a very low amount being excreted via the expired air. The largest elimination was observed to occur during the first 24 hours.']",,

Substantial quantities of unchanged triforine were recovered only from feces. The first metabolite to be identified was N-[2,2,2-trichloro-1-(piperazin-1-yl)ethyl]-formamide, which is formed by the cleavage of an entire side chain. In later metabolic studies with 14C labelling in the piperazine ring and aliphatic side chain, triforine underwent virtually complete metabolism after administration as a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg bw. N-[2,2,2-Trichloro-1-(piperazin-1-yl)ethyl]formamide, the major radiolabelled urinary component in rats receiving [piperazine 14C]-triforine, accounted for 46-53% of the dose over 0-24 hr; however, in rats receiving side-chain-labelled 14C-triforine, the proportion was reduced to 24-27% after a single 10 mg/kg bw dose and 21-24% after repeated doses. It was excreted as the glucuronide. The side-chain metabolite trichloroethanol and its glucuronide represented 18-21% of the dose. Another side-chain metabolite occurring in the urine was the N-acetylcysteine conjugate of 2,2,2-trichloroethylamine, which represented 13-15% of the administered dose. In feces collected from female rats over 0-48 hr, 3.6% of the single 10 mg/kg bw dose and 3.4% of the repeated doses was present as N-[2,2,2-trichloro-1-(piperazin-1-yl)ethyl]formamide. This metabolite was not detected in the feces of rats receiving 1,000 mg/kg bw. Very little unchanged triforine (0-1%) was detected in the feces of rats given the low dose, whereas it represented 70-80% of the dose in rats given 1,000 mg/kg bw. This result suggests that absorption of triforine is a saturable process, unless there is extensive biliary excretion at the high dose.']",

Those tested were dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, diisobutyl, dihexyl, di(2-ethylhexyl), diisodecyl, and benzyl butyl phthalate. Hair from a skin area (1.3 cm in diameter) on the back of male F344 rats was clipped, the 14(C)phthalate diester was applied in a dose of 157 mumol/kg, and the area of application was covered with a perforated cap. The rat was restrained and housed for 7 days in a metabolic cage that allowed separate collection of urine and feces. Urine and feces were collected every 24 hr, and the amount of (14)C excreted was taken as an index of the percutaneous absorption. At 24 hr, diethyl phthalate showed the greatest excretion (26%). As the length of the alkyl side chain increased, the amount of (14)C excreted in the first 24 hr decreased signficantly. The cumulative percentage dose excreted in 7 days was greatest for diethyl, dibutyl, and diisobutyl phthalate, about 50-60% of the applied (14)C; and intermediate (20-40%) for dimethyl, benzyl butyl, and dihexyl phthalate. Urine was the major route of excretion of all phthalate diesters except for diisodecyl phthalate. This compound was poorly absorbed and showed almost no urinary excretion. After 7 days, the percentage dose for each phthalate that remained in the body was minimal showed no specific tissue distribution. Most of the unexcreted dose remained in the area of application. These data show that the structure of the phthalate diester determines the degree of dermal absorption. Absorption maximized with diethyl phthalate and then decreased significantly as the alkyl side chain length increased.', 'In rats, 80% of dermally applied (14)C-DIDP (ring-label) was recovered at the site of application 7 days after the application. Only 2% of the applied dose was recovered in other tissues or excreta with a total recovery of only 82% reported. In another study in rats in which total recoveries were better (94% or greater), similar results were obtained.', '(14)C-DIDP was applied to the skin and the dose site was occluded. At 1, 3, and 7 days, 96, 92, and 93% of the doses, respectively, were still at the application site. Only trace amounts of radioactivity were found in other tissues and excreta. The total absorbed dose was approximately 4% of the administered dose.', 'Six male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed for 6 hours by inhalation (head only) to 91 mg/cu m of (14)C-DIDP. Excreta were collected over a 72-hour period and 3 animals were analyzed for radioactivity immediately after the exposure and at 72 hours after the exposure. Assuming a minute volume of 200 mL for the rats, the estimated total amount of DIDP inhaled would be approximately 14.4 umoles. The initial body burden was 8.3 umoles, indicating that approximately 58% of what was inhaled was retained in the body. Twelve percent of the initial body burden was in the gut and 85% was in the lung. 73% of the dose to the lung was cleared during the first 72 hours, indicating that absorption of DIDP or its metabolites from the lung into the rest of the body was about 73%.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for DIISODECYL PHTHALATE (9 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['Diisodecyl phthalate (DiDP) is an isomeric mixture of phthalates with predominantly 10-carbon branched-dialkyl chains, widely used as a plasticizer for polyvinyl chloride. The extent of human exposure to DiDP is unknown in part because adequate biomarkers of exposure to DiDP are not available. We identified several major metabolites of DiDP in urine of adult female Sprague-Dawley rats after a single oral administration of DiDP (300 mg/kg). These metabolites can potentially be used as biomarkers of exposure to DiDP. The metabolites extracted from urine were chromatographically resolved and identified by their chromatographic behavior and full scan negative ion electrospray ionization mass spectrum. The identity of metabolites with similar molecular weights was further examined in accurate mass mode. For some metabolites, unequivocal identification was done using authentic standards. Among these were the hydrolytic monoester of DiDP, monoisodecyl phthalate (MiDP), detected as a minor metabolite, and one omega oxidation product of MiDP, mono(carboxy-isononyl) phthalate (MCiNP), which was the most abundant urinary metabolite. We also tentatively identified other secondary metabolites of MiDP, mono(hydroxy-isodecyl) phthalate, mono(oxo-isodecyl) phthalate, mono(carboxy-isoheptyl) phthalate, mono(carboxy-isohexyl) phthalate, mono(carboxy-isopentyl) phthalate, mono(carboxy-isobutyl) phthalate, and mono(carboxy-ethyl) phthalate. Oxidative metabolites of diisoundecyl phthalate (DiUdP) and diisononyl phthalate(DiNP) were also detected suggesting the presence of DiUdP and DiNP in the DiDP formulation. The urinary concentrations of all these metabolites gradually decreased in the 4 days following the administration of DiDP. MCiNP and other DiDP secondary metabolites are more abundant in urine than MiDP, suggesting that these oxidative products are better biomarkers for DiDP exposure assessment than MiDP. Additional research on the toxicokinetics of these metabolites is needed to understand the extent of human exposure to DiDP from the urinary concentrations of MCiNP and other DiDP secondary metabolites.', '... Radiolabeled DIDP (carboxyl-(14)C) was administered /to Sprague Dawley rats (200 g body weight)/ in corn oil by gavage at doses of 0.1-11.2 and 1,000 mg/kg. Feces were collected over 24-hour periods. Urine was collected over 12-hour periods. ... In urine, phthalic acid and the oxidized monoester derivative were detected but not monoisodecyl phthalate (MIDP) or DIDP at any of the doses. The percentage of radioactivity associated with the monoester derivative group increased with increasing dose from 52% after 0.1 mg/kg to 72% after 1,000 mg/kg. Concurrently, the proportion of radioactivity associated with phthalic acid was observed to decrease from 38 to 18% after 0.1 and 1,000 mg/kg doses, respectively. In feces, the monoester oxidative derivative, MIDP and DIDP were detected. Because of potential bacterial degradation of DIDP or its metabolites in feces, quantification of the data is difficult. It was readily apparent, however, that with increasing dose the percentage of parent compound recovered in feces increased: 30%, 55% and 60% after 0.1, 11 and 1,000 mg/kg, respectively. The percentage of oxidative derivatives of the monoester and of MIDP were respectively 25 and 30%, 14 and 26%, 13 and 13% after 0.1, 11 and 1,000 mg/kg, respectively. When bile samples were taken from 0-24 hours following dosing or when liver and kidneys samples were taken 72 hours following dosing, DIDP was not detected in extracts. The data based on end products suggest a metabolic scheme comparable to the one reported for DEHP: de-esterification to monoester form and an alcohol moiety by apparent non-specific pancreatic lipase and intestinal mucosa esterases prior to absorption; the high content of MIDP in feces is consistent with this proposed mechanism. Further metabolism of the monoester by omega or omega-1 oxidation probably occurred in the liver. With increasing dose, the percentage of fecal radioactivity associated with the parent compound was increased by a factor of two comparing 0.1 to 1,000 mg/kg doses. Therefore it is probable that esterases capacity has been partially saturated. The parent compound is recoverable from feces even at the lowest dose, which is not the case for DEHP, for which an absorption threshold of 200 mg/kg in a single intake was reported. Below this value, the parent DEHP was not detected. In contrast, even at extremely low doses, DIDP may be less susceptible to the hydrolysis step prerequisite to absorption. Phthalic acid and apparent oxidative products of MIDP were identified in urine. In bile, it is indicated that only monoester metabolites were detected accounting in part for the content in feces. With increasing dose the metabolite composition in bile was not altered, suggesting that metabolic capacity by that route was not compensated. In urine the percentage of radioactivity associated with phthalic acid decreased with dose while an increase was observed in the oxidative derivatives of the monoester. The percentage of phthalic acid ranged from 38% at 0.1 mg/kg to 18% at 1,000 mg/kg, far exceeding the value of 3% phthalic acid associated with DEHP exposures. The markedly higher production of phthalic acid suggests that DIDP derivatives may be more susceptible to de-esterification within the body perhaps due to destabilisation of the ester bond resulting from the highly branched nature of the ester groups. However, the decrease in phthalic acid content with increasing DIDP dose may suggest partial saturation of metabolite capacity. ...', 'High molecular-weight phthalates, such as diisononyl phthalate (DINP), and diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), are widely used as plasticizers in the manufacturing of polymers and consumer products. Human biological monitoring studies have employed the metabolites of DINP and DIDP as biomarkers to assess human exposure. In this review, we summarize and analyze publicly available scientific data on chemistry, metabolism, and excretion kinetics, of DINP and DIDP, to identify specific and sensitive metabolites. Human biological monitoring data on DINP and DIDP are scrutinised to assess the suitability of these metabolites as biomarkers of exposure. Results from studies carried out in animals and humans indicate that phthalates are metabolised rapidly and do not bioaccmulate. During Phase-I metabolism, ester hydrolysis of DINP and DIDP leads to the formation of hydrolytic monoesters. These primary metabolites undergo further oxidation reactions to produce secondary metabolites. Hence, the levels of secondary metabolites of DINP and DIDP in urine are found to be always higher than the primary metabolites. Results from human biological monitoring studies have shown that the secondary metabolites of DINP and DIDP in urine were detected in almost all tested samples, while the primary metabolites were detected in only about 10% of the samples. This indicates that the secondary metabolites are very sensitive biomarkers of DINP/DIDP exposure while primary metabolites are not. The NHANES data indicate that the median concentrations of MCIOP and MCINP (secondary metabolites of DINP and DIDP, resp.) at a population level are about 5.1 ug/L and 2.7 ug/L, respectively. Moreover, the available biological monitoring data suggest that infants/children are exposed to higher levels of phthalates than adults.', 'Di-isodecyl phthalate (DiDP), primarily used as a plasticiser, is a mixture of isomers with predominantly ten-carbon branched side chains. Assessment of DiDP exposure has not been conducted before because adequate biomarkers were lacking. In 129 adult volunteers with no known exposure to DiDP, the urinary concentrations of three oxidative metabolites of DiDP: monocarboxyisononyl phthalate (MCiNP), monooxoisodecyl phthalate (MOiDP) and monohydroxyisodecyl phthalate (MHiDP), previously identified in DiDP-dosed rats, were estimated by solid-phase extraction coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) using the respective oxidative metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate since authentic standards of the DiDP oxidative metabolites were unavailable. Interestingly, the hydrolytic monoester of DiDP, monoisodecyl phthalate (MiDP), was not detected in any of the samples, while MCiNP, MHiDP and MOiDP were detected in 98%, 96% and 85%, respectively, of the samples tested. MCiNP was excreted predominantly in its free form, whereas MOiDP was excreted as its glucuronide. MCiNP, MHiDP and MOiDP eluted as clusters of multiple peaks from the HPLC column probably due to the presence of numerous structurally similar isomers present in commercial DiDP formulations. The urinary concentrations of these oxidative metabolites correlated significantly (p < 0.0001) with each other, thus confirming a common precursor. The urinary concentrations of these DiDP oxidative metabolites also correlated significantly (p < 0.0001) with oxidative metabolites of di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP) suggesting the potential presence of DiNP isomers in commercial DiDP or simultaneous use of DiDP and DiNP in consumer products. The concentrations presented are semiquantitative estimates and should be interpreted cautiously. Nevertheless, the higher frequency of detection and higher urinary concentrations of MCiNP, MHiDP and MOiDP than of MiDP suggest that these oxidative metabolites are better biomarkers for DiDP exposure assessment than MiDP. These data also suggest that unless oxidative metabolites are measured, the prevalence of exposure to DiDP will probably be underestimated.']",

Following topical application to the eye of a 0.25 or 0.5% solution of the drug, reduction in IOP usually occurs within 15-30 minutes, reaches a maximum within 1-5 hours, and persists about 24 hours.', 'Approximately 90% of an oral dose of timolol maleate is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract. Absorption of the drug is not reduced by food. Only about 50% of an oral dose reaches systemic circulation as unchanged drug since timolol undergoes extensive metabolism on first pass through the liver. Peak plasma concentrations of the drug usually are reached within 1-2 hr after oral administration. Considerable interindividual variation in plasma concentrations attained have been reported with a specific oral dose of timolol.', 'Timolol is 10-60% bound to plasma proteins, depending on the assay method employed. The drug is distributed into milk.', 'Timolol has a plasma half-life of 3-4 hr; plasma half-life is essentially unchanged in patients with moderate renal insufficiency. Approximately 80% of timolol is metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites. The unchanged drug and its metabolites are excreted in urine. Only small amounts of the drug are removed by hemodialysis.', 'Plasma kinetics and beta-receptor blocking and -binding activity of timolol was studied in six healthy volunteers following its intravenous 0.25 mg dose. Timolol concentrations were measured using radioreceptor assay (RRA), blocking activity by comparing the dose ratios (DRs) of the infusion rates of isoprenaline required to increase heart rate by 25 bpm (I25) and binding activity by determining the extent to which timolol occupied beta 1 -receptors of rabbit lung and beta 2-receptors of rat reticulocytes in undiluted plasma samples. Timolol was eliminated from plasma with a mean half-life for the elimination phase of 2.6 hours. The dose antagonized potently isoprenaline-induced tachycardia at least for four hours. The effect was excellently correlated with the estimated beta 2-receptor binding activity of timolol in the circulating plasma. In conclusion, the small intravenous timolol dose was eliminated from plasma by a fashion, which was very similar to its eighty-fold higher oral doses reported earlier in the literature. The 0.25 mg dose was of considerable systemic beta-receptor blocking and -binding activity, that may help to explain its reported side-effects following ocular drug administration. The extent to which beta-blocking agents occupy rabbit lung beta 1- and rat reticulocyte beta 2-receptors in the circulation appears to predict the intensity and selectivity of their beta-blocking effects in healthy volunteers.']","['Timolol is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme, with minor contributions from CYP2C19. 15-20% of a dose undergoes first-pass metabolism. Despite its relatively low first pass metabolism, timolol is 90% metabolized. Four metabolites of timolol have been identified, with a hydroxy metabolite being the most predominant.', 'It is metabolized extensively by the liver, and only a small amount of unchanged drug appears in the urine.', 'The metabolism of timolol maleate to its ring cleavage ethanolamine and glycine products was studied in 108 patients with essential hypertension who received 10 mg oftimolol maleate, administered as a single oral dose. The metabolism of timolol maleate was determined to be partly under monogenic control of the debrisoquine-type. The mean plasmatimolol maleate concentration in poor metabolizers of debrisoquine were double that of extensiv metabolizers. /Timolol maleate/', 'Timolol has known human metabolites that include 4-[4-[3-(tert-butylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy]-1,2,5-thiadiazol-3-yl]morpholin-2-ol.']","['Timolol half-life was measured at 2.9 ± 0.3 h hours in a clinical study of healthy volunteers.', 'Plasma half-life 3-5 hr']"

Tramadol is also used off-label in the treatment of premature ejaculation.'],"['Tramadol modulates the descending pain pathways within the central nervous system through the binding of parent and M1 metabolite to μ-opioid receptors and the weak inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.   Apart from analgesia, tramadol may produce a constellation of symptoms (including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, constipation, sweating and pruritus) similar to that of other opioids.   **Central Nervous System**  In contrast to [morphine], tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release. At therapeutic doses, tramadol has no effect on heart rate, left-ventricular function or cardiac index. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed.  Tramadol produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centres. The respiratory depression involves both a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem centres to increases in CO2 tension and to electrical stimulation.   Tramadol depresses the cough reflex by a direct effect on the cough centre in the medulla. Antitussive effects may occur with doses lower than those usually required for analgesia.  Tramadol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in the setting of oxycodone overdose.  Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range. Risk of convulsions may also increase in patients with epilepsy, those with a history of seizures or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure (such as head trauma, metabolic disorders, alcohol and drug withdrawal, CNS infections), or with concomitant use of other drugs known to reduce the seizure threshold.  Tramadol can cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs (e.g., anti-depressants, migraine medications). Treatment with the serotoninergic drug should be discontinued if such events (characterized by clusters of symptoms such as hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, mental status changes including confusion, irritability, extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. Tramadol should not be used in combination with MAO inhibitors or serotonin-precursors (such as L-tryptophan, oxitriptan) and should be used with caution in combination with other serotonergic drugs (triptans, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, St. John’s Wort) due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.  **Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle**  Tramadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in gastric, biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.  **Endocrine System**  Opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or -gonadal axes. Some changes that can be seen include an increase in serum prolactin and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes.  Hyponatremia has been reported very rarely with the use of tramadol, usually in patients with predisposing risk factors, such as elderly patients and/or patients using concomitant medications that may cause hyponatremia (e.g., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, diuretics). In some reports, hyponatremia appeared to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and resolved with discontinuation of tramadol and appropriate treatment (e.g., fluid restriction). During tramadol treatment, monitoring for signs and symptoms of hyponatremia is recommended for patients with predisposing risk factors.  **Cardiovascular**  Tramadol administration may result in severe hypotension in patients whose ability to maintain adequate blood pressure is compromised by reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of drugs such as phenothiazines and other tranquillizers, sedative/hypnotics, tricyclic antidepressants or general anesthetics. These patients should be monitored for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dose of tramadol.  **QTc-Interval Prolongation**  The maximum placebo-adjusted mean change from baseline in the QTcF interval was 5.5 ms in the 400 mg/day treatment arm and 6.5 ms in the 600 mg/day mg treatment arm, both occurring at the 8h time point. Both treatment groups were within the 10 ms threshold for QT prolongation. Post-marketing experience with the use of tramadol containing products included rare reports of QT prolongation reported with an overdose. Particular care should be exercised when administering tramadol to patients who are suspected to be at an increased risk of experiencing torsade de pointes during treatment with a QTc-prolonging drug.  **Abuse and Misuse**  Like all opioids, tramadol has the potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Therefore, tramadol should be prescribed and handled with caution.  **Dependence/Tolerance**  Physical dependence and tolerance reflect the neuroadaptation of the opioid receptors to chronic exposure to an opioid and are separate and distinct from abuse and addiction. Tolerance, as well as physical dependence, may develop upon repeated administration of opioids, and are not by themselves evidence of an addictive disorder or abuse. Patients on prolonged therapy should be tapered gradually from the drug if it is no longer required for pain control. Withdrawal symptoms may occur following abrupt discontinuation of therapy or upon administration of an opioid antagonist. Some of the symptoms that may be associated with abrupt withdrawal of an opioid analgesic include body aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness or restlessness, anxiety, runny nose, sneezing, tremors or shivering, stomach cramps, tachycardia, trouble with sleeping, unusual increase in sweating, palpitations, unexplained fever, weakness and yawning.']","['Compounds with activity like OPIATE ALKALOIDS, acting at OPIOID RECEPTORS.

Following administration, racemic tramadol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed, with a bioavailability of 75%. This difference in absorption and bioavailability can be attributed to the 20-30% first-pass metabolism. Peak plasma concentrations of tramadol and the primary metabolite M1 occur at two and three hours, respectively. Following a single oral dose of 100mg of tramadol, the Cmax was found to be approximately 300μg/L with a Tmax of 1.6-1.9 hours, while metabolite M1 was found to have a Cmax of 55μg/L with a Tmax of 3 hours.   Steady-state plasma concentrations of both tramadol and M1 are achieved within two days of dosing. There is no evidence of self-induction. Following multiple oral doses, Cmax is 16% higher and AUC is 36% higher than after a single dose, demonstrating a potential role of saturable first-pass hepatic metabolism in increasing bioavailability.  **Intramuscular Administration**  Tramadol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following intramuscular administration. Following injection of 50mg of tramadol, Cmax of 166μg/L was found with a Tmax of 0.75 hours.  **Rectal Administration**  Following rectal administration with suppositories containing 100mg of tramadol, Cmax of 294μg/L  was found with a Tmax of 3.3 hours. The absolute bioavailability was found to be higher than oral administration (77% vs 75%), likely due to reduced first-pass metabolism with rectal administration compared to oral administration.', 'Tramadol is eliminated primarily through metabolism by the liver and the metabolites are excreted primarily by the kidneys, accounting for 90% of the excretion while the remaining 10% is excreted through feces. Approximately 30% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, whereas 60% of the dose is excreted as metabolites.  The mean terminal plasma elimination half-lives of racemic tramadol and racemic M1 are 6.3 ± 1.4 and 7.4 ± 1.4 hours, respectively. The plasma elimination half-life of racemic tramadol increased from approximately six hours to seven hours upon multiple dosing.', 'The volume of distribution of tramadol is reported to be in the range of 2.6-2.9 L/kg. Tramadol has high tissue affinity; the total volume of distribution after oral administration was 306L and 203L after parenteral administration. Tramadol crosses the blood-brain barrier with peak brain concentrations occurring 10 minutes following oral administration. It also crosses the placental barrier with umbilical concentrations being found to be ~80% of maternal concentrations.', 'In clinical trials, the clearance rate of tramadol ranged from 3.73 ml/min/kg in renal impairment patients to 8.50 ml/min/kg in healthy adults.', 'The objective of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of two orally administered doses of tramadol (5 and 10 mg/kg) and its major metabolite (O-desmethyltramadol) (M1) in loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta). After oral administration, the half-life of tramadol administered at 5 and 10 mg/kg was 20.35 and 22.67 hr, whereas the half-life of M1 was 10.23 and 11.26 hr, respectively. The maximum concentration (Cmax) for tramadol after oral administration at 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg was 373 and 719 ng/mL, whereas that of M1 was 655 and 1,376 ng/mL, respectively. Tramadol administered orally to loggerhead sea turtles at both dosages provided measurable plasma concentrations of tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol for several days with no adverse effects. Plasma concentrations of tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol remained >/= 100 ng/mL for at least 48 and 72 hr when tramadol was administered at 10 mg/kg.', 'The mean absolute bioavailability of a 100 mg oral dose is approximately 75%.

From the extensive metabolism, there have been identified at least 23 metabolites. There are two main metabolic pathways: the O-demethylation of tramadol to produce O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) catalyzed by CYP2D6 and the N-demethylation to N-desmethyl-tramadol (M2) catalyzed by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6.  The wide variability in the pharmacokinetic properties between patients can partly be ascribed to polymorphisms within the gene for CYP2D6 that determine its enzymatic activity. CYP2D6\\*1 is considered the wild-type allele associated with normal enzyme activity and the ""extensive metabolizer"" phenotype; 90-95% of Caucasians are considered ""extensive metabolizers"" (with normal CYP2D6 function) while the remaining 5-10% are considered ""poor metabolizers"" with reduced or non-functioning enzyme. CYP2D6 alleles associated with non-functioning enzyme include *3, *4, *5, and *6 while alleles associated with reduced activity include *9, *10, *17, and *41.  Poor metabolizers have reduced activity of the CYP2D6 enzyme and therefore less production of tramadol metabolites M1 and M2, which ultimately results in a reduced analgesic effect as tramadol interacts with the μ-opioid receptor primarily via M1.   There are also large differences in the frequency of these alleles between different ethnicities: \\*3, \\*4, \\*5, \\*6, and \\*41 are more common among Caucasians while \\*17 is more common in Africans for example. Compared to 5-10% of Caucasians, only ~1% of Asians are considered poor metabolizers, however Asian populations carry a much higher frequency (51%) of the CYP2D6\\*10 allele, which is relatively rare in Caucasian populations and results in higher exposure to tramadol.  Some individuals are considered ""ultra-rapid metabolizers"", such as those carrying CYP2D6 gene duplications (CYP2D6*DUP) or multiplications. These individuals are at risk of intoxication or exaggerated effects of tramadol due to higher concentrations of its active metabolite (M1). The occurrence of this phenotype is seen in approximately 1% to 2% of East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), 1% to 10% of Caucasians, 3% to 4% of African-Americans, and may be >10% in certain racial/ethnic groups (ie, Oceanian, Northern African, Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican). The FDA label recommends avoiding the use of tramadol in these individuals.', 'Tramadol is extensively metabolized after oral administration by a number of pathways, including CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, as well as by conjugation of parent and metabolites. Approximately 30% of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug, whereas 60% of the dose is excreted as metabolites. The remainder is excreted either as unidentified or as unextractable metabolites. The major metabolic pathways appear to be N- and O-demethylation and glucuronidation or sulfation in the liver. One metabolite (O-desmethyltramadol, denoted M1) is pharmacologically active in animal models. Formation of M1 is dependent on CYP2D6 and as such is subject to inhibition, which may affect the therapeutic response', 'Tramadol has as many as 11 metabolites. One metabolite (o-desmethyl tramadol, also called M1) may have greater opiate effects than the parent drug (for example, 200-300 times greater opiate effect than tramadol) but still lower than morphine. In animals that produce this metabolite in sufficient amounts, some analgesic action may be attributed to opiate-mediated effects from the active metabolite. The other metabolites have not been shown to have active analgesic activity.', 'Tramadol is extensively metabolized by a number of pathways, including CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, as well as by conjugation of parent metabolites. One metabolite, M1, is pharmacology active in animal models. The formation of M1 is dependent upon Cytochrome P-450(2D6) and as such is subject to both metabolic induction and inhibition which may affect the therapeutic response. /Salt not specified/', 'Tramadol is a synthetic opioid, widely used for post-surgical and chronic pain.

Tramadol and its metabolites O-desmethyltramadol (M1), N-desmethyltramadol (M2), N,N-didesmethyltramadol (M3), N,O-didesmethyltramadol (M5) were detected by GC/MS in biological fluids (femoral blood, bile, urine, gastric content) and viscera (brain, lung, liver and kidney). The tramadol concentration in femoral blood was 61.83 ug/mL which is approximately 30 times higher than that believed to be lethal. According with other Authors, a preferential formation of M1 over M2 (M1/M2 ratio >1) is indicative of acute death, while M1/M2 ratio <1 suggests that death occurred after a longer time lapse from ingestion.', 'Tramadol has known human metabolites that include N-desmethyltramadol and O-desmethyl-tramadol.']","['Tramadol reported a half-life of 5-6 hours while the M1 metabolite presents a half-life of 8 hours.', 'Healthy elderly subjects aged 65 to 75 years have plasma tramadol concentrations and elimination half-lives comparable to those observed in healthy subjects less than 65 years of age.

Diisoocytl phthalate was less readily metabolized than butylglycolbutyl phthalate by all species.', 'Strains of Mycobacterium and Nocardia isolated because of their ability to use di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) as sole carbon source also grew on diethyl, diisooctyl, and butyl benzyl phthalates. As the two bacteria grew on di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, they excreted products that increased the solubility of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and diisooctyl, dihexyl, and diisodecyl but not butyl benzyl or di-n-butyl phthalates. The solubilizer was produced by Mycobacterium sp. even when grown on a water-soluble substrate such as acetate. Addition of the solubilizer to culture media enhanced the degradation of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and diisooctyl phthalate by Mycobacterium sp. and Nocardia sp. but not butyl benzyl phthalate. The extent of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate degradation by Mycobacterium sp. in media amended with the solubilizer was reduced and the initiation of degradation was delayed if the solubilizer was first treated with protease. The effect of protease was not a result of its toxicity to Mycobacterium or use of the enzyme preparation for growth of the organism. The results thus show that microbial products increase the solubility of certain phthalates and enhance their degradation.']",

(See all compounds classified as Hypoglycemic Agents.)'],"['The study used higher doses of vanadyl sulfate (equivalent to 7.56 and 15.12 mg V/kg), which are within the same dose range as doses used for demonstrating its anti-diabetic activity. Absolute bioavailability, calculated as ratio of vanadium AUC ext after oral or iv administration, were similar between doses (15.7% and 16.4%), indicating that for pharmacologically active doses vanadyl sulfate actual bioavailability is relatively high and not dose-dependent.', 'Dietary vanadium as vanadyl sulfate is retained in rat tissues: heart >spleen >thyroid >lung >kidney; about 10% of the injected dose is retained in the tissues in experimental animals. Bone retains about 50% of it, presumably because vanadates are isomorphic with phosphates.', 'Rats absorbed an average of 0.5% of orally administered vanadyl sulfate.', 'Plants of garlic (Allium sativum) were germinated at 30 °C in a 5 mM calcium sulfate aqueous solution for 4 days. Plants were then suspended in vanadyl oxide sulfate aqueous solutions (concentration range 1.6x10-4 to 5.0x10-3 M, volume: 50 mL and initial pH approx 3-4). After timed incubations, varying from 10 min to 8 days, plant samples were removed from solution and washed. Their roots, cloves, and leaves were cut and immediately subjected to ESR spectroscopy. Examination of the ESR parameters allowed exclusion of the presence of VO(H2O)5 +2 species and indicated that the ions were almost totally bound to ligands having low molecular weights. ... Most of adsorbed VO+2 ions accumulated in the root as soluble low molecular weight complexes of o-diphenolic compounds. However, with increasing concentration, immobilized oxovanadium(IV) ions, possibly associated with acid polysaccharide components, were also detected. When plants were exposed to solutions containing VO+2 and EDTA (ligand-to-metal molar ratio= 1:1) spectra of roots showed only the isotropic signals of the soluble VO(EDTA) complex, and they are mobile enough to be extensively translocated to the tops. /Vanadyl oxide sulfate aqueous solution/', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for VANADYL SULFATE (8 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['Within tissues in organisms, V3+ and V4+ predominate because of largely reducing conditions; in plasma, however, which is high in oxygen, V5+ is formed.']","['The half-life for vanadium elimination from the kidney of Wistar rats fed vanadyl sulfate trihydrate (0.75 mg/mL) in drinking water for 3 weeks was found to be 11.7 days. It is supported by another study in which the half-lives were determined of vanadium elimination from various organs of male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with sodium orthovanadate or vanadyl sulfate at concentrations ranging from 1.6-160 umol V/kg bw/day for a week. The values varied greatly among organs; the liver and kidney have the shortest (about 3-4 days) and the testis the longest (about 14-16 days) half-lives. Almost all the tissues showed a slightly longer vanadium half-life in the group of rats fed sodium orthovanadate compared to those receiving vanadyl sulfate.', 'Experiments were conducted to determine the distribution and effects of selected vanadium (V) salts in male rats following continuous ingestion. Wistar rats were continuously fed drinking water ad. Lib. containing 5 and 50 ppm V as vanadyl sulfate and sodium orthovanadate for a 3-month period. At the end of the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th week, blood, kidney, liver, bone, muscle, and digestive tract were collected and analyzed for V utilizing flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. In addition, the decline of vanadium residues in tissues after 6 weeks of continuous exposure was studied in selected groups. At the 5 and 50 ppm levels, V had no significant effect on body weights or hematocrit values. In the tissues of animals given 5 ppm of V salt, the V contents were essentially the same as those in controls. The tissues of animals given 50 ppm of V salt showed increased levels of vanadium. Kidney had the highest concentration, followed by bone, liver, and muscle. In general, the tissue concentrations of V in animals given 50 ppm as sodium orthovanadate were higher than those exposed to similar levels as vanadyl sulfate. The V concentration in kidney of the animals given 50 ppm sodium orthovanadate continued to rise until the 9th week of sampling, whereas the V content of other tissues analyzed for the treated animals plateaued from the 3rd week. The concentration of V in tissues after cessation of exposure declined rapidly except in the bone. After 6 weeks of the depletion phase the concentration of vanadium in animals given vanadyl sulfate returned to control values except in bone and kidneys. The animals exposed to sodium orthovanadate contained relatively high concentrations of V even after a 6-week depletion phase.']"

Thiobencarb was rapidly absorbed after oral administration as judged by the rate of excretion. No significant sex-related or dose group differences in absorption were noted. Excretion was relatively rapid at all doses tested, with a majority of radioactivity eliminated in the urine and feces by 48 hours. The extent of excretion was completed by 72 hours at the 300 mg/kg dose, but the mechanism responsible for this delay was not identified. No significant sex- or dose-related differences in urinary or fecal excretion of thiobencarb derived radioactivity were noted. Repeated low oral dosing did not affect elimination of thiobencarb in either male or female rats. Fecal elimination of (Phenyl-U-(14)C)-thiobencarb derived radioactivity was a minor route of excretion, and for urine, no significant sex- or dose-related differences in amount of radioactivity excreted by this route were observed. Residual levels of thiobencarb derived radioactivity were also minor (less than 0.5% of an administered dose).', '(14)C Benzyl methylene labeled benthiocarb was taken up through the roots and translocated into whole plants by rice, barnyard grass, wild amaranth, smartweed, and lambsquarters plants. It was translocated from a leaf into other leaves also.

Urinary and fecal metabolites of (Phenyl-U-(14)C)-Thiobencarb were isolated and identified by HPLC, TLC, and mass spectral analysis. The major metabolite detected was the glycine conjugate 4-chlorohippuric acid, comprising between 74-81% of an administered dose in urine. Other metabolites detected included 4-chlorobenzyl methyl sulfoxide and -sulfone, des-ethyl thiobencarb, and 4-chlorobenzoic acid, each representing less than 10% of an administered dose of thiobencarb. A single high or repeated low oral dose did not significantly affect the urinary or fecal metabolite profile for thiobencarb in male or female rats.', 'Roots of rice and barnyard millet were soaked in (14)C benthiocarb solution for 48 hr.

Hydrolysis of unextractable radioactivity with b-glucosidase and hydrogen chloride yielded the aglycons.', '(14)CO Thiocarbamates were administered to rats. Relatively large amounts (14)CO2, as compared to (14)C in the urine, were expired. Analyses of urine, feces and liver indicated that these compounds were metabolized via two pathways. One pathway produced larger amounts of (14)CO2 from thiocarbamates than from the sulfoxide derivatives and their GSH and cysteine conjugates. In the other pathway, metabolism of a thiolcarbamate proceeded via the sulfoxide and S-(N,N-dialkylcarbamoyl)glutathione. Degradation of the glutathione conjugate produced the corresponding cysteine conjugate, mercapturic acid and mercaptoacetic acid. The appropriate mercapturic acids were seen in urine when benthiocarb, cycloate, molinate and pebulate were administered to rats.', 'The fate of (14)C-labeled benthiocarb was studied with white mice in vivo and in vitro. After oral administration, benthiocarb was rapidly translocated into organs. There was rapid urinary excretion of labeled material; slight excretion in feces; and only a little expired. The major metabolites identified were: 4-chlorohippuric acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, glucuronide of 4-chlorobenzoic acid, and 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol. In liver homogenates, the microsomal fraction exhibited highest activity and NADP accelerated the degradation. In vitro metabolites were identified as: N-desethylbenthiocarb, bis(4-chlorobenzyl)mono- and di-sulfides, and 4-chlorobenzoic acid.', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for THIOBENCARB (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']",

MHD is formed via reduction by several members of the aldo-keto reductase family of cytosolic liver enzymes and exists as a racemate in plasma in an approximate ratio of 80% (S)-MHD to 20% (R)-MHD. MHD is further metabolized to glucuronide conjugate metabolites for excretion, and small amounts are oxidized to 10-,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxycarbamazepine (DHD) which is pharmacologically inactive.

More than 95% of the dose appears in the urine, with less than 1% as unchanged oxcarbazepine. Fecal excretion accounts for less than 4% of the administered dose. Approximately 80% of the dose is excreted in the urine either as glucuronides of MHD (49%) or as unchanged MHD (27%); the inactive DHD accounts for approximately 3% and conjugates of MHD and oxcarbazepine account for 13% of the dose.', 'The disposition of the new anti-epileptic agent oxcarbazepine (10,11-dihydro-10-oxo-5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine-5-carboxamide) has been studied in two healthy volunteers following an oral 400 mg dose of (14)C-labelled drug. The dose was excreted almost completely in the urine (94.6 and 97.1%) within six days. Fecal excretion amounted to 4.3 and 1.9% of the dose in the two subjects. In the 0-6 days urine samples the biotransformation products have been isolated and identified. 10,11-Dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine (GP 47,779) and its two diastereoisomeric O-glucuronides were found as main metabolites. Taken together, they accounted for 79% of urinary (14)C. Unchanged oxcarbazepine, and its sulfate and glucuronide conjugates were isolated in smaller amounts only (13%). Other minor metabolites were the trans- and cis-isomers of 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-carbamazepine (approximately 4%), and a phenolic derivative of GP 47,779 (less than 1%). The biotransformation of oxcarbazepine proceeds mainly by reduction to GP 47,779, and subsequent conjugation with glucuronic acid. Reduction is stereospecific, favoring the S-configuration of GP 47,779. Direct conjugation of oxcarbazepine, in the enol form, is a minor pathway. Oxidative reactions are unimportant.', '... The interaction potential of oxcarbazepine is relatively low. However, enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin, phenobarbital or carbamazepine can reduce slightly the concentrations of 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy-carbazepine (monohydroxy derivative, MHD). Verapamil may moderately decrease MHD concentrations, but this effect is probably without clinical relevance. The influence of oxcarbazepine on other antiepileptic drugs is not clinically relevant in most cases. However, oxcarbazepine appears to increase concentrations of phenytoin and to decrease trough concentrations of lamotrigine and topiramate. Oxcarbazepine lowers concentrations of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, and women treated with oxcarbazepine should consider additional contraceptive measures. Due to the absent or lower enzyme-inducing effect of oxcarbazepine, switching from carbamazepine to oxcarbazepine can result in increased serum concentrations of comedication, sometimes associated with adverse effects. ...']","['The plasma half-life of oxcarbazepine is approximately 2 hours and the plasma half-life of MHD is approximately 9 hours.', 'Oxcarbazepine: 2 hours. 10-Monohydroxy metabolite: 9 hours.

Carbidopa also inhibits the metabolism of [levodopa] in the GI tract, thus, increasing the bioavailability of [levodopa].  The presence of additional units of circulating [levodopa] can increase the effectiveness of the still functional dopaminergic neurons and it has been shown to alleviate symptoms for a time. The action of carbidopa is very important as [levodopa] is able to cross the blood-brain barrier while dopamine cannot. Hence the administration of carbidopa is essential to prevent the transformation of external [levodopa] to dopamine before reaching the main action site in the brain.  The coadministration of carbidopa with [levodopa] has been shown to increase the half-life of [levodopa] more than 1.5 times while increasing the plasma level and decreasing clearance. The combination therapy has also shown an increase of the recovery of [levodopa] in urine instead of dopamine which proves a reduced metabolism. This effect has been highly observed by a significant reduction in [levodopa] requirements and a significant reduction in the presence of side effects such as nausea. It has been observed that the effect of carbidopa is not dose-dependent.']","['Agents used in the treatment of Parkinson&apos;s disease.

Among their common properties are a requirement for metabolic activation to intermediates with antitumor efficacy and the presence in their chemical structures of N-methyl groups, that after metabolism, can covalently modify cellular DNA. The precise mechanisms by which each of these drugs acts to kill tumor cells are not completely understood. (From AMA, Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p2026) (See all compounds classified as Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating.)']","['Intracellular concns of prednimustine (PM), chlorambucil (CLB), phenylacetic acid mustard (PAAM) & prednisolone (P) were measured in different experimental tumor cell lines that had been incubated with either PM or CLB + P. For intracellular analytical determination, we modified a high-pressure liquid chromatographic method for the detection of these substances in plasma. Intact PM could be detected in the intracellular compartment of the incubated tumor cells. PM-incubated cells from PM-injected rats exhibited a higher intracellular concn-time integral (PAAM) & longer concn-time profiles for drugs with alkylating capacity than did cells exposed to the CLB + P mixture or to CLB. PAAM was not detectable after incubation of cells with PM, whereas in CLB-incubated cells the AUC of PAAM exceeded that of the parent drug CLB. Our in vitro results therefore favour the concept of a facilitated intracellular uptake & an increased antiproliferative effect for PM versus CLB & CLB + P.', 'A single oral soln dose (40 mg/sq m) of (14)C-prednimustine was administered to each of four cancer patients. Plasma, urine, & feces were collected at appropriate times & analyzed for total radioactivity. Plasma samples were analyzed for prednimustine. Peak plasma levels of radioactivity (1-3 ug (14)C-prednimustine equivalents) occurred at 1.5-3 hr in 3 patients & at 5-6 hr in one patient. No intact prednimustine was detected in the plasma; this means that if present, it would be at a concn of 0.02 ug/ml or less & would account for <1% of the total drug-related material at the time of peak plasma levels. Solvent-extractable metabolites had a plasma half-life of about 8 hr or less. By 24 hr essentially all the plasma radioactivity appeared to be covalently bound, & it was eliminated slowly with an estimated terminal elimination half-life of about 10 days. Rapid urinary excretion occurred in the first 24 hr, & 40%-60% of the dose was recovered in the urine in 72 hr. Although prednimustine was well absorbed, the ester was subject to extensive presystemic metab & was not present in the systemic circulation after oral admin.', 'Prednimustine (Leo 1031), a conjugate of prednisolone & chlorambucil, was administered to humans & baboons & the metabolic fate of the cmpd ascertained. Compared to the excretion of prednisolone, prednimustine is excreted more slowly & less quantitatively, with a significant part of the cmpd being retained in the body. Hydrolysis of the prednimustine molecule appears to take place quantitatively after oral admin, but a substantial part of prednimustine appears to remain intact after its iv admin. Fecal excretion of radioactivity was minor compared to the urinary route. The biliary excretion in the baboon was relatively insignificant. Localisation within the lung & spleen of the baboon points to a potential therapeutic use of this drug in neoplastic conditions affecting these organs.']","['The pharmacokinetic characteristics of prednisolone & of chlorambucil & its beta-oxidized metabolite, phenylacetic mustard (PAM) were studied in plasma after the oral admin of 200 mg prednimustine (Sterecyt) & a regimen consisting of 20 mg prednisolone plus 20 mg chlorambucil, respectively. A total of 12 cancer patients completed this trial. The drugs were given in a cross-over study as single doses, & serial plasma samples were collected for 32 h. Chlorambucil & PAM were assayed by a gas chromatographic/mass spectrometry method & prednisolone, by radioimmunoassay. The median relative availability of the prednisolone & chlorambucil moiety in prednimustine was 19% & 16%, respectively. Prednisolone, as well as chlorambucil & PAM, appeared later & at a significantly lower concn in plasma after treatment with prednimustine as compared with the mixture of chlorambucil & prednisolone. We also found that the elimination phase of chlorambucil & PAM in plasma is prolonged after the admin of prednimustine as compared with chlorambucil per se. In contrast, the elimination of the prednisolone moiety of prednimustine & that following the admin of a plain prednisolone tablet did not seem to differ. The modified plasma profile of the alkylating components following prednimustine admin may be important for the clinical efficacy of prednimustine.', 'This report describes the physicochemical & pharmacokinetic parameters of 7 chlorambucil esters, which were compared with those of chlorambucil. These esters were designed as chlorambucil prodrugs to incr the brain penetration & concn vs time profile of chlorambucil within the CNS for potential treatment of brain tumors. They include four aliphatic esters from 1-8 carbon chains in length (chlorambucil-methyl, -propyl, -hexyl, & -octyl esters) & 3 aromatic esters, including the phenylmethyl, phenylethyl & prednisolone ester of chlorambucil, prednimustine. The esters were lipophilic & possessed log octanol:water partition coefficients (log P values) that ranged from 4.05 to >8.0. All retained alkylating activity, which was reduced compared with that of chlorambucil. In addition, all were metabolized in vivo in the rat to yield chlorambucil alone. Measurement of the in vitro rate of ester hydrolysis of the cmpds to yield chlorambucil in rat plasma demonstrated that short-chain aliphatic & aromatic chlorambucil esters were rapidly broken down to their parent compound. The plasma half-lives of the compounds increased with the increasing length & complexity of their ester chain. This may have been related to an incr in the binding of the long-chain esters to plasma proteins, protecting the ester from nonspecific plasma esterases, & to a reduced affinity of plasma esterases to these esters. Pharmacokinetic analysis of chlorambucil-hexyl, -octyl, & -prednisolone esters by HPLC demonstrated that following their iv admin in the rat (in doses equivalent to equimolar chlorambucil, 10 mg/kg), they yielded only low concns of active compounds in plasma & brain. The brain:plasma ratio of these was low & similar to that of chlorambucil, & no ester demonstrated anticancer activity superior to that obtained after the admin of equimolar chlorambucil (5 mg/kg i.v., days 1-5) against brain-sequestered Walker 256 carcinosarcoma in the rat.']",

At 96 h, 86.0% and 15.2% of the administered dose had been excreted in urine and feces, respectively. Nine (unidentified) metabolites were present in the urine.', 'Female rats given 2-(14)C-pirimiphos-methyl at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg bw orally were bled (cardiac puncture, three rats per time interval) at 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 7 or 24 hr after dosing. Maximum blood concentrations (at 0.5 hr) were 2-3 ug/mL, declining by 50% 1 hr after dosing. By 24 hr, concentrations of (14)C in blood were 0.2-0.3 ug/mL, and of pirimiphos-methyl, 0.01-0.02 ug/mL. Rats treated for 4 days with 2-(14)C-pirimiphos-methyl at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg bw per day and sacrificed at intervals of 24 hr did not show any increase in blood concentrations with time. Tissue concentrations of total radioactivity in the liver, kidney and fat over the 4 days were generally less than 2 mg pirimiphos-methyl equivalents/kg tissue (concentrations of unchanged pirimiphos-methyl being less than 0.15 mg/kg tissue). There was no evidence of tissue accumulation.', 'Adult male Wistar rats were intubated with (14)C-labelled pirimiphos-methyl at a dose of 1 mg/kg bw per day. Four groups of three animals were dosed for 3, 7, 14 or 21 days and sacrificed 24 hr after the final dose. A further five groups of three rats were given similar doses for 28 days and sacrificed 1, 3, 7, 14, or 28 days after dosing. For each of the nine groups, one rat that did not receive pirimiphos-methyl was used as a control. After sacrifice, samples of liver, kidney, muscle, fat, erythrocytes and plasma were taken for analyses. Urine and feces were collected from two rats during the 24 hr after the seventh dose. Recovery of (14)C from (14)C-labelled pirimiphos-methyl added to control tissues was 96.9 +/- 5.2%. In all tissue samples taken at all time intervals, the concentration of radioactivity was very low, close to or below detection limits. Concentrations did not increase with repeated dosing. Liver concentrations were fairly constant (0.03 ppm) and similar concentrations were detected in some kidney samples. In other tissues, the concentration of radioactivity was generally below the limits of detection (0.04-0.06 ppm). Three days after cessation of dosing, one animal had detectable concentrations of radioactivity in the kidney. At 7 days and on subsequent days, no residues were found. Excretion was between 70% and 80% of a single dose, after administration of seven consecutive doses, providing evidence for rapid metabolism and elimination rather than poor absorption.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for PIRIMIPHOS-METHYL (6 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']","['Twelve metabolites of pirimiphos-methyl were separated by thin-layer chromatography from the urine of rats & a dog.

It acts on the heart muscle to improve the heart's rhythm. Moricizine has potent local anesthetic activity and membrane stabilizing effect. Decreases excitability, conduction velocity, and automaticity as a result of slowed atrioventricular (AV) nodal and His-Purkinje conduction. Decreases the action potential duration (APD) in Purkinje fibers; also decreases the effective refractory period (ERP) but to a lesser extent than the APD, so the ERP/APD ratio is increased. Decreases the maxiumum rate of Phase 0 depolarization (V max ), but does not affect action potential amplitude or maximum diastolic potential. Does not affect atrial, AV nodal, or left ventricular refractory periods and has minimal effect on ventricular repolarization (evidenced by the overall decrease in JT interval). Has no effect on sinoatrial (SA) nodal or intra-atrial conduction and only minimal effect on sinus cycle length and sinus node recovery time. In the Vaughan Williams classification of antiarrhythmics, moricizine is considered to be a class I agent. It has properties of class IA, IB, and IC agents but does not clearly belong to any of the three subclasses. It has less effect on the slope of phase 0 and a greater effect on action potential duration and effective refractory period than class IC agents.""]","['A class of drugs that inhibit the activation of VOLTAGE-GATED SODIUM CHANNELS.
