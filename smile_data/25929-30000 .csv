Absorption takes place mainly in the duodenum.', 'Parenteral injection of sodium selenite or selenate in male AS2 rats ... demonstrated pronounced accumulation in liver, kidney, and adrenal where chronic administration showed accumulation in testes.']","['Most dietary selenium is in the form of selenomethionine (the major dietary form of selenium) or selenocysteine, both of which are well absorbed. Other forms of selenium include selenate and selenite, which are not major dietary constituents, but are commonly used in fortified foods and dietary supplements. Two pools of reserve selenium are present in the body. The first is as selenomethionine, which is not known to have a physiological function separate from that of methionine. The second reserve pool is the selenium found in liver glutathione peroxidase. Ingested selenite, selenate, and selenocysteine are all metabolized directly to selenide, the reduced form of selenium. Selenomethionine can also be metabolized to selenide. /Selenate/', 'Selenate and selenite injected intravenously into rats were speciated by the HPLC-ICP MS method with use of an enriched stable isotope as the tracer. In dose-relation experiments, 82(Se)-enriched selenate or selenite was injected intravenously into male Wistar rats of 8 weeks of age (three rats/group) at single doses of 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200 ug/kg body weight for the selenate group, and 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 ug/kg body weight for the selenite group. The animals were sacrificed 1 or 24 hr later, and the concentrations and distributions of selenium-82 in the liver, kidneys, serum, and urine remaining in the bladder or 24-hr urine were determined. In time-course experiments, (82)Se-enriched selenate and selenite were injected at doses of 50 and 10 ug/kg body weight, respectively, and the animals were sacrificed 5, 15, 30, 60 and 180 min later. It was suggested that selenate is directly taken up by the liver with an efficiency of approximately 1/2 compared with selenite, the latter being taken up by the liver after being metabolized to selenide in red blood cells. Although selenate and selenite were metabolized differently in the bloodstream, and also a part of only selenate was excreted directly into the urine, the selinium-82 taken up by the liver was shown to be metabolized in a manner indistinguishable between selenate and selenite. Selenium-82 of selenite origin but not of selenate origin was suggested to undergo redox reaction in the bloodstream. These results suggest that although parenteral selenate is utilized less efficiently by the body, it is utilized in the liver in a similar manner to selenite much more safely. /Selenate/', 'Metabolic pathways for Se in the body were studied for selenite and selenate, with the use of enriched (82)Se ... . The concentrations of (82)Se in organs and body fluids and the distributions of their constituents depending on the dose and time after the intravenous administration of (82)Se-selenite and -selenate to rats were determined. Selenite was taken up by red blood cells within several minutes, reduced to selenide by glutathione, and then transported to the plasma, bound selectively to albumin and transferred to the liver. Contrary to selenite, intact selenate was either taken up directly by the liver or excreted into the urine. The (82)Se of selenite origin and that of selenate origin were detected in the forms of the two Se peak materials in the liver, A and B. The former one was methylated to the latter in vivo and in vitro. The latter one was identical with the major urinary metabolite and it was identified as Se-methyl-N-acetyl-selenohexosamine (selenosugar). The chemical species-specific metabolic pathway for Se was explained by the metabolic regulation through selenide as the assumed common intermediate for the inorganic and organic Se sources and as the checkpoint metabolite between utilization for the selenoprotein synthesis and methylation for the excretion of Se. /Selenate/']",

The following Cu(II) complexes were used: Cu(II)-(CyHH)2 (CyHH, cyclo(L-histidyl-L-histidyl)), Cu(II)(OP)2 (OP, o-phenanthroline), Cu(II)(HGG) (HGG, L-histidyl-glycylglycine), and Cu(II)(en)2 (en, ethylenediamine). The methyl radical adduct of alpha-(pyridyl-4-N-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN-CH3) was obtained from the reaction of ascorbic acid with all Cu(II) complexes used here in the presence of a spin trap, POBN, and dimethyl sulfoxide, indicating the generation of .OH. Glutathione, N-acetylcysteine, and hydroquinone reacted with both Cu(II)(CyHH)2 and Cu(II)(OP)2 to generate POBN-CH3, while these reductants did not react with either Cu(II)(HGG) or Cu(II)(en)2. The DNA strand scission caused by reaction mixtures of Cu(II) complexes with reductants was investigated under the same conditions as the ESR spin-trapping experiments. Addition of ascorbic acid to mixtures of these four Cu(II) complexes and DNA resulted in DNA strand breakage. Reaction mixtures of glutathione, N-acetylcysteine, or hydroquinone with Cu(II)-(HGG) or Cu(II)(en)2 did not cause DNA strand scission within the concentration range used. The results obtained here suggest that there is a good correlation between POBN-CH3 formation and DNA strand scission. Thus, DNA strand scission may be caused by .OH generated from the reaction of some Cu(II) complexes with biological reductants under aerobic conditions. Since ascorbic acid, glutathione, and N-acetylcysteine are present in living cells, some Cu(II) complexes may be capable of initiating DNA damage in the presence of these reductants.']",

We measured DP and its dechlorinated analogs in matched maternal blood-placenta-cord blood samples from 72 residents of the e-waste recycling area of Wenling, China. DP was detected in cord sera, indicating the occurrence of prenatal DP exposure and the transfer of DP across the placenta. The concentration ratio in the cord serum and maternal serum was estimated to be 0.45 for syn-DP and 0.35 for anti-DP, indicating the placenta partially limited DP transfer with a greater extent for anti-DP. The DP concentrations in the maternal serum, placenta, and cord serum strongly correlated, indicating that DP could transfer between the tissues. The DP concentrations in the matched samples could be predicted from each other. The anti-DP/total DP concentration ratios in the placentas and cord sera were significantly different from those in the maternal sera, suggesting that DP stereoselectively bioaccumulates in human tissues. When the congener concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were used as control variables, DP and total triiodothyronine concentrations were associated in the sera from mothers who had lived in Wenling for over 20 years.', 'Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and Dechlorane Plus (DP) were measured in both human hair and paired serum samples from a cohort of university students in South China. Segmental analysis was conducted to explore gender difference and the relationships between the hair and serum. The concentrations of total PBDEs in the hair and serum samples were in a range of 0.28-34.1 ng/g dry weight (dw) and 0.16-156 ng/g lipid weight (lw), respectively. Concentrations of sum DPs (sum of the syn-DP and anti-DP isomers) in all hair samples ranged from nd-5.45 ng/g dry weight. Concentrations of most PBDEs and decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE) in distal segments (5-10 cm from the scalp) were higher than those in the proximal segments (0-5 cm from the scalp) (t-test, p < 0.05), which could be due to the longer exposure time of distal segments. The proximal segments exhibited a unique congener profile, more close to that in the serum rather than the distal segments of hair. An obvious gender difference was found in the levels of  sum of PBDEs using integrated hair samples, while the difference disappeared when considering alone the proximal segments of hair (0-5 cm from scalp) for both genders. This paper provides supplement to the current knowledge on sources of BFRs and DPs in hair and declares the importance of segmental analysis.', 'Dechlorane Plus (DP) and a dechlorinated product of DP were measured in 34 matched human hair and serum samples (19 males and 15 females) collected from e-waste recycling workers in South China. The DP (sum of syn- and anti-DP) concentrations in hair and serum samples ranged from 6.3 to 1100 ng/g dry weight and from 22 to 1400 ng/g lipid weight (lw). The levels of anti-Cl11-DP ranged from 0.02 to 1.8 ng/g in hair and from not detected to 7.9 ng/g lw in serum. Significant positive correlations for both DP and anti-Cl11-DP concentrations between hair and serum samples were found (p<0.05), indicating hair to be a suitable matrix for human DP exposure. However, a significant difference was found in the DP isomer composition between hair and serum, suggesting stereoselective bioaccumulation during the absorption of DP into hair. A sharp gender difference was found in the levels of DP in hair. Moreover, syn-DP, anti-DP and anti-Cl11-DP in hair significantly correlated with those in serum for male samples, but not for female samples. The observed gender differences in the present study may be, in part, ascribed to the much longer hair exposure time for females than males due to the difference in sampling distance from the scalp.', 'The tissue concentrations of dechlorane plus and its analogues were determined in ducks collected from several e-waste recycling villages of Taizhou, China. Compared with the published literature, the relatively high concentrations of these compounds were detected in ducks, indicating serious DP contamination. Since both the duck meat and eggs were important components for diet, this result reminded us of keeping a watchful eye on human dietary exposure to DP and its analogues in this study area. The wet-weight concentrations of DP and its analogues were significantly related to tissue lipid content (p < 0.05), indicating that the lipid pools predominantly impacted the distribution of DPs in ducks. On the basis of lipid adjustment, the significantly lower levels in brain than those in liver and blood, displayed the occurrence of liver sequestration and blood-brain barrier to DP and its analogues in the duck (p < 0.05). The maternal transfer of DP and Mirex was not obviously limited, and the transferring extent of Dec 602 was over one. The stereo-selected accumulation of two DP isomers occurred among tissues with preference to syn-DP in blood, and to anti-DP in brain. The values of lipid-adjusted monodechlorinated products mainly originated from the exterior environment in ducks.', 'For more Absorption, Distribution and Excretion (Complete) data for Dechlorane plus (7 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']",,

It is essential for life and regulates or supports a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic functions. Topical hydrocortisone is used for its anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive properties to treat inflammation due to corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones characterised by an ability to bind with the cortisol receptor and trigger a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic and homeostatic effects. Glucocorticoids are distinguished from mineralocorticoids and sex steroids by having different receptors, target cells, and effects. Technically, the term corticosteroid refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, but is often used as a synonym for glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity. They act by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha, the most important of which is the IL-2. Reduced cytokine production limits T cell proliferation. Glucocorticoids also suppress humoral immunity, causing B cells to express lower amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis. The diminished amounts of IL-2 also leads to fewer T lymphocyte cells being activated.']",['Drugs used to treat or prevent skin disorders or for the routine care of skin.

Two study phases were performed. In the recovery phase animals were dosed and urine, feces and expired air were collected at 11 time intervals over 8 days. At least 5 animals per sex received oral doses of 200 mg/kg, while 5 males each received 20 mg/kg by either a single oral or i.v. administration.

Tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate and its metabolites were rapidly eliminated following a single bolus dose in male and female rats. ...No difference was observed between sexes or between doses. A biphasic (plasma) elimination followed first order kinetics. While urinary excretion was identified as the primary route of elimination, the extent of elimination was dependent upon the amount administered and the route of administration. This was also true for fecal elimination. Urinary and fecal elimination were sex-independent with eighty-nine percent of the dose being eliminated by 72 hours. Total body burden at the end of eight days was less than 1%...', 'Radiolabelled (14)C-tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (99 % pure by GC) was administered in a single oral dose of 16.4 mg/kg bw (0.05 mmol/kg) in olive oil to groups of 3-5 male Wistar rats. Absorption was calculated from the radioisotopic measurements of cumulative urinary excretion and cumulative exhalation 7 days post-exposure, and of the amount in blood and tissues of rats sacrificed at 3, 6, 12 hours as well as 1, 3 or 7 days following administration. Absorption of radiolabelled TMCPP was rapid. Radiolabel was detected throughout the body as early as 3 hours post-administration. At 7 days, 76 % of the administered oral dose had been excreted in the urine and in expired air or remained in the carcass. Another 22 % was excreted in the feces. TMCPP, however, undergoes enterohepatic circulation and it is not clear if this proportion includes unabsorbed TMCPP, TMCPP excreted in the bile, or both. Therefore, at least 76 % was absorbed following oral administration to rats.', '(14)C-labelled TMCPP was administered in a single oral dose of 50 umol/ kg bw in olive oil to male Wistar rats. After 3 hours, the highest concentration of (14)C was found in the liver (29 nmol/g tissue) and the kidney (27 nmol/g tissue) followed by the lung (9 nmol/g tissue). The concentrations in blood, heart, spleen, brain, testis, adipose tissue and muscle were all below 4 nmol/g tissue.', 'Wistar rats were given 50 umol TMCPP/kg bw orally. Most of the (14)C-labelled TMCPP was excreted within 24 hours and by 7 days, less than 1 % remained in the tissues. Urinary excretion accounted for 67 %, fecal excretion for 22 %, and expired air for 8 % of the label. Also biliary excretion of (14)C-TMCPP was measured in cannulated rats for 48 hours following the same oral dose.

Large thorotrast deposits were also present in liver cells.

TCAB is isosteric to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and has been shown to bind to the Ah receptor. Following oral administration of (14C)TCAB (3.2 and 32 mg/kg), 39-45% of the dosed radioactivity was excreted into the urine and 53-56% was recovered in the feces within 48 hr. Less than 6% of the dosed radioactivity remained in the tissues examined at 96 hr. After intravenous administration (3.2 mg/kg), 33% of the dose was excreted in the bile during 6 hr. ... The absolute oral bioavailability was determined to be 30%. The extensive azo reduction of TCAB decreases its systemic absorption after oral administration and thereby limits the amount of parent compound available to interact with the Ah receptor and decreases the Ah receptor-mediated toxicity.""]","[""The metabolism of 3,3',4,4'-tetrachloroazobenzene (TCAB), an important environmental and occupational toxicant, by rat liver microsomes has been examined in a NADPH-generating system. The metabolic pathways were delineated by the combined use of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The rate of (14C)TCAB metabolism using induced microsomes was found to be 381 +/- 59 pmol/min/mg microsomal protein. Approximately 13% of the radioactivity from the (14C)TCAB substrate was covalently bound to the macromolecular pellet at the end of a 2 hr incubation period. In addition, three distinct TCAB metabolites were isolated from the organic extracts and subsequently identified. Experiments with carbon monoxide, 2-diethylaminoethyl 2,2-diphenylvalerate hydrochloride (SKF 525-A), and control (uninduced) microsomes indicated the participation of the cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenases. ..."", ""Following intravenous administration of (14C)3,3',4,4'-Tetrachloroazobenzene (TCAB)  (3.2 mg/kg), ... TCAB metabolites in urine were identified using LC/MS. The major metabolites were sulfate ester conjugates of hydroxylated mono- or dichloroaniline derivatives. Some of these metabolites were also acetylated.""]","[""After intravenous administration, the disappearance of (14C) 3,3',4,4'-Tetrachloroazobenzene (TCAB)  from blood was monitored, and the pharmacokinetic profile was consistent with a two-compartment model. Pharmacokinetic parameters reveal that the compound is readily cleared from the blood with a half-life of 4.0 hr, clearance of 12.3 mL/min/kg, and an apparent volume of distribution of 4.3 liters/kg.""]"

(See all compounds classified as Anticonvulsants.)']","['A pharmacokinetic and tissue residue study was conducted to assess the risks associated with human consumption of polar bears in arctic Canada that have been exposed to the immobilizing drug Telazol, a mixture of tiletamine hydrochloride and zolazepam hydrochloride. Twenty-two bears were remotely injected with about 10 mg/kg of Telazol. Following immobilization, serum samples were collected serially at regular intervals until the bears awakened. Sixteen of the bears were relocated and killed under permit by local hunters at various times from 0.5 to 11 days after dosing. Serum, kidney, muscle and adipose tissue samples were collected immediately after death. ... In addition, the serum and tissue samples collected at the time of death were analyzed for both parent drugs, for one metabolite of tiletamine (CI-398), and for three metabolites of zolazepam (metabolites 1, 2 and 4). A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination best fit the time-series data for the drugs in serum during the immobilization period. This model gave half-lives (mean +/- SE) for tiletamine and zolazepam of 1.8+/-0.2 hr and 1.2+/-0.08 hr, respectively, clearance values of 2.1+/-0.3 l x hr(-1) x kg(-1) and 1.1+/-0.1 l x hr(-1) x kg(-1), and volumes of distribution of 5.2+/-0.6 L/kg and 1.8+/-0.2 L/kg. The concentrations of both drugs and their metabolites declined rapidly to trace levels by 24 hr post-dosing, although extremely low concentrations of some metabolites were encountered sporadically over the entire sampling period. In particular, zolazepam metabolite 2, remained detectable in fat and muscle tissue at the end of the study, 11 days after dosing. It was concluded that during immobilization, both tiletamine and zolazepam levels decline rapidly in a monoexponential fashion, and their pharmacokinetic parameters in polar bears are similar to those observed in other species. Tissue levels of the drugs and their metabolites declined sufficiently rapidly that individuals eating meat from exposed bears would be unlikely to experience pharmacological effects from the drugs. Nevertheless, slight exposure to the drugs and/or their metabolites might be possible for an indeterminate time after dosing.']",,

Charles River female rats were given a single 500 mg/kg oral gavage dose of 35S or 14C ferric ferbam. Biliary excretion, blood distribution, placental transfer and milk secretion were studied. In rats dosed with 35S, at 24 hours post dosing, radioactivity in feces, urine, expired air, whole blood and bile amounted to 16.9, 22.7, 18.1, 0.6 and 1% of the applied dose, respectively. In rats dosed with 14C, at 24 hours post dosing, radioactivity in the same matrices amounted to 20.0, 42.9, 0.6, 0.9 and 1.4% of the applied dose, respectively. The total of whole blood, liver, kidneys, muscle and brain amounted to about 3.8% of the dose. Analysis of the expired air indicated that /carbon disulfide/ represented >99.9% of the sulfur containing metabolites in the expired air. A trace of COS was also detected. Analysis of urine indicated three ferbam metabolites: inorganic sulfate, dimethylammonium ion (dimethyl amine) and a glucuronide of /dimethyldithiocarbamide/. The authors concluded that after absorption, some of the /carbon disulfide/ is eliminated in the expired air, while the remainder is oxidized to inorganic sulfate. They also speculated that some of the N,N-dimethyldithiocarbamate is absorbed intact and then conjugated with glucuronic acid. The authors speculated that the conversion of ferbam to N,N-dimethyldithiocarbamate followed by decomposition to diethylamide and /carbon disulfide/ probably takes place in the gut, since ferbam is known to decompose to /carbon disulfide/ and diethylamide under acidic conditions.', 'Ferbam does not appear to be stored in the tissues of rats or dogs, but feeding of ferbam to rats increased the skeletal stores of iron.', ""The disposition and metabolism of ferbam were studied in rats. Male rats weighing 125-275 g, pregnant rats on day 16 of gestation, and lactating rats 6 days post partum were given single oral doses of 500 mg/kg bw spiked with 24 uCi of either 35S- or 14C-labelled compound. The ferbam was suspended in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose. After dosing, each male rat was placed in a metabolism cage for examination of feces, urine, and expired air. At termination of the experiment, the rat was sacrificed for analysis of radiolabel. Bile was collected from some of the male rats. Five pups per lactating mother were left for nursing, and the dams and pups were sacrificed 24 hr after dosing. About 40-70% of the dose of labelled ferbam was absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract within the first 24 hr. In rats receiving 35S-ferbam, 23% of the radiolabel was found in urine, 18% in expired air, and 1% in bile; only small amounts were found in tissues, including blood, kidneys, muscle, and brain. In rats receiving 14C-ferbam, 43% of the radiolabel was found in urine and 1.4% in bile, whereas only 0.6% was recovered in expired air. The other tissues contained only small amounts of radiolabel. In the pregnant rats, a small but significant amount of radiolabel readily crossed the placenta into the fetus. In lactating rats, radiolabel was secreted into the milk, absorbed by the pups, and excreted in the pups' urine."", '(35)S and (14)C labeled ferbams were administered as an oral dose to rats. After absorption through the gastrointestinal tract, (35)S activity was observed in urine (22.7%), expired air (18.1%), bile (1.O%), and small amounts in tissues. When (14)C ferbam was used, (14)C was found in urine (42.9%, bile (1.4%), expired air (0.6%), and small amounts in tissues. The metabolite in expired air was identified as carbon disulfide.

Their mode of action is either non-specific, resulting in increased immune responsiveness to a wide variety of antigens, or antigen-specific, i.e., affecting a restricted type of immune response to a narrow group of antigens. The therapeutic efficacy of many biological response modifiers is related to their antigen-specific immunoadjuvanticity.

Antihistamines competitively antagonize various physiological effects of histamine including increased capillary permeability and dilatation, the formation of edema, the ""flare"" and ""itch"" response, and gastrointestinal and respiratory smooth muscle constriction. Within the vascular tree, H1- receptor antagonists inhibit both the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator effects of histamine. Depending on the dose, H1- receptor antagonists can produce CNS stimulation or depression. Most antihistamines exhibit central and/or peripheral anticholinergic activity. Antihistamines act by competitively blocking H1- receptor sites.

The hepatic cytochrome enzyme CYP3A4 metabolizes drospirenone to two primary metabolites: the acid form of drospirenone through the opening of the lactone ring and the 4,5\xad dihydrodrospirenone formed by reduction, followed by sulfation. Both metabolites are pharmacologically inactive.']",['The elimination half-life of estetrol is approximately 27 hours. Half-life may range between 19-40 hours.']

The major metabolites in the susceptible cereal weeds, Avena fatua, Alopecurus myosuroides and Lolium perenne, and in resistant cotton were products of N-demethylation. This reaction in the cereal weeds proceeded only very slightly beyond the state the mono-N-demethylated metabolites some of which retain considerable phytotoxicity.

Evidence from studies _in vivo_ and _in vitro_ demonstrate antagonistic actions towards serotonin and histamine. Pizotifen blocks the postsynaptic 5-HT2 receptors, as supported by antagonism of several direct agonists of 5-HT receptors. It is an antagonist at histamine H1 receptors, and is weakly anticholinergic. It also binds to α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors, and dopamine receptors. Pizotifen elicits a minimal effect as an epinephrine or bradykinin antagonist. Pizotifen exhibits weak sedative properties in mouse and monkey studies, as indicated by inhibition of locomotion and potentiation of barbiturates, without changes in cardiac or respiratory rates. In dogs, intravenous administration of pizotifen cause rapid hypotension but was reversed to normal within 30 minutes. Pizotifen was shown to inhibit serotonin uptake in the isolated perfused cat spleen and, _in vivo_, inhibits serotonin-induced contractions in rat uterus and cat nictiating membrane. In contrast, pizotifen demonstrated a venoconstrictor activity _in vivo_ when orally or intravenously administered to saphenous veins in conscious dogs. Pizotifen has the potential to stimulate the appetite and may cause weight gain upon treatment.   In a double-blind clinical study of patients with mild to moderate depression, treatment of pizotifen led to clinical improvement of the depressive symptoms. However, deterioration of the schizophrenic emotional symptoms was also observed in patients with depression and chronic schizophrenia. This indicates that pizotifen may potentially improve the symptoms of patients with depressions in conjunction with migraines.   Neuroprotective effect of pizotifen was investigated _in vitro_ in a mouse cell model of Huntington's disease (HD). According to a chemical screen of a mouse HdhQ111/Q111 striatal cell model of HD, treatment of pizotifen was associated with increased ATP levels and decreased activation of caspase-3, leading to enhanced cell viability. Transient activation of ERK signalling pathway lasting for less than 3 hours was also observed. In the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD, rotarod performance of the mouse treated with pizotifen was seen, accompanied by an increase in DARPP-32 protein expression and restoration of striatal area. However these effects being reflected _in vivo_ are not established.""]","['Mood-stimulating drugs used primarily in the treatment of affective disorders and related conditions.

The onset of action of oral isosorbide mononitrate is not sufficiently rapid to be useful in aborting an acute anginal episode.'],"['Isosorbide mononitrate is an anti-anginal agent and vasodilator that relaxes vascular smooth muscle to prevent and manage angina pectoris. The pharmacological action is mediated by the active metabolite, [nitric oxide], which is released when isosorbide mononitrate is metabolized. Nitric oxide works on both arteries and veins, but predominantly veins: by relaxing veins and reducing the central venous pressure, nitric oxide causes venous pooling and a decrease in the venous return to the heart, thus decreasing cardiac preload. In healthy subjects, the stroke volume is decreased and venous pooling can occur in the standing posture, leading to postural hypotension and dizziness.   At therapeutic doses of isosorbide mononitrate, nitric oxide has a bigger effect on larger muscular arteries over small resistance arteries. Arterial relaxation leads to reduced systemic vascular resistance and systolic blood (aortic) pressure, decreasing to decreased cardiac afterload. The direct dilator effect on coronary arteries opposes the coronary artery spasm in variant angina or angina pectoris. At larger doses, nitric oxide causes the resistance arteries and arterioles to dilate, reducing arterial pressure via coronary vasodilatation. This leads to increased coronary blood flow. Reduced cardiac preload and afterload caused by nitric oxide causes a reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption; decreased myocardial oxygen demand, along with increased coronary blood flow, leads to an increased in the oxygen content of coronary sinus blood and the relief from ischemia.   The end effect of isosorbide mononitrate include decreased cardiac oxygen consumption, redistribution coronary flow toward ischemic areas via collaterals, and the relief of coronary spasms. Nitric oxide can also increase the rate of relaxation of cardiac muscles, which is an effect outside of vascular smooth muscles. Organic nitrates can also relax other types of smooth muscles, including esophageal and biliary smooth muscle. The anti-anginal activity of isosorbide mononitrate was observed about 1 hour after dosing, and the peak effect was achieved from 1-4 hours after dosing. The duration of anti-anginal action of at least 12 hours was observed with an asymmetrical dosing regimen.']","['A diverse group of agents, with unique chemical structures and biochemical requirements, which generate NITRIC OXIDE.

Following oral administration of 20 mg, only 2% of isosorbide mononitrate was excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. Among the excreted dose, nearly half of the dose was found de-nitrated in urine as isosorbide and sorbitol: approximately 30% is excreted as isosorbide and about 17% is the 2-glucuronide of mononitrate. These metabolites were not vasoactive or pharmacologically active.

Treatment is limited to a single course of 6 months duration per lifetime.'],"['Gestrinone is a synthetic steroidal hormone which has androgenic, anti-estrogenic and anti-progestogenic properties.   The findings of several studies suggest that gestrinone is as effective as danazol in the treatment of infertility associated with endometriosis and is better tolerated, in terms of adverse effects.    Gestrinone has moderate anti-estrogen, and anti-gonadal properties, which can lead to increased concentrations of free testosterone, and decrease the level of sex hormone-binding globulin, suppress the FSH and LH hormone peak levels and decrease the LH mean to reduce estrogen levels. In addition, gestrinone has a direct effect on the endometrium and ectopic endometrial receptors, which have the roles of anti-progesterone and anti-estrogen effects lead to endometrial and ectopic endometrial atrophy to achieve therapeutic effects.  Gestrinone inhibits the release of pituitary gonadotropins. The effect on ovarian hormone secretion results in the atrophy of endometrial tissue, resulting in the regression of endometriosis. Gestrinone is structurally related to norgestrel and possesses some androgenic and progestogenic activity. However, the gestrinone has an antiprogesterone effect on endometrial tissue.  The effect of oral gestrinone, 2.5 mg biweekly for 6 months, was studied in a group of 11 women with mild or moderate endometriosis laparoscopically confirmed. Painful symptoms were alleviated in all patients within 8 weeks from the start of treatment. Gonadotropins, prolactin (PRL) 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E2), estrone (E1), progesterone (P), androstenedione (A), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) remained in the physiological follicular phase range.   Total testosterone (TT) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) decreased, and free testosterone (FT) slightly increased. Metabolic studies showed a decrease in total triglyceride level, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and VLDL cholesterol.  Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoprotein B were found to be increased during gestrinone therapy. It can be extrapolated that gestrinone possesses antiestrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic effects at therapeutic dosages both by acting on both central and peripheral steroid receptors.']","['Oral contraceptives which owe their effectiveness to hormonal preparations.

The radioactivity from both radiolabels was excreted predominantly in the feces, mainly within 48 hours; less than 1% of the dose was excreted in urine. Blood and plasma radioactivity reached maximum levels by one hour, while levels in the liver and kidneys peaked after 4-12 hours. The activity in blood and tissues was very low, suggesting that erythrosine is not extensively absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Of the tissues examined (liver, kidney, thyroid, brain, and pituitary), the highest levels of radioactivity were found in the liver (maximally 0.145% of the dose of (14)C; 0.188% of the dose of (125)I). Thyroid residues of (14)C were at trace or non-detectable levels, while levels of (125)I were detectable but low (maximally approximately 0.01% of the dose), indicating that neither erythrosine nor its ring-containing metabolites accumulated in the thyroid. The magnitude of the (125)I levels in the thyroid was so low that it was not possible to conclude whether the activity resulted from free ) (125)I-iodide in the dose or from (125)I-iodide formed by a small degree of metabolic deiodination of erythrosine. No (14)C or (125)I was detectable in the brain or pituitary.', 'A clinical study evaluated the bioavailability and metabolism of erythrosine. Five human volunteers (four males and one female, ages 21 to 35 years) received erythrosine in a milkshake at dose levels of 5, 10, or 25 mg/day in weekly increments for a period of three weeks. The study demonstrated slowly and slightly increasing levels of total serum iodine and /protein-bound iodine/ PBI associated with the weekly increasing erythrosine doses. In the other tests for serum /thyroxine/ T4, /triiodothyronine/ T3, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels, erythrosine concentration, urinary iodine and erythrosine excretion, and T3 - resin uptake remained unchanged throughout the three weeks. Increases in serum PBI and total serum iodine during exposure period indicate that a portion of the iodine ingested as erythrosine appears to be absorbed from the GI tract. The authors considered that the lack of changes in concentration of TSH, T4, and T3 in serum indicated that both the thyroid function and thyroid regulatory mechanisms were unaffected by the ingestion of erythrosine during a 3-week period at a dose as high as 25 mg/day. Analytical testing of erythrosine in serum and urine revealed levels less than the limit of detection (0.05 mg/L).', ""...Three subjects received a single oral dose of 80 mg of (131)I- radio-labelled erythrosine in a milkshake. Three other subjects consumed a single oral dose of 75 mg of (131)I-Erythrosine in a water vehicle.

(131)I administered as (131)I-Erythrosine was eliminated rapidly and nearly completely, whereas whole body (131)I content was at levels of 1.0% or less of the administered dose within seven days. No differences were observed between the rates of elimination of erythrosine administered in the different vehicles and fecal elimination of (131)I-erythrosine was rapid after an initial delay of 24 hours. Fecal recovery of erythrosine ranged from 80 to 100% with four subjects exhibiting approximately 100% recovery where recoveries of less than 100% were attributed to incomplete collection since radioactivity was not detected in whole body counts, urinary (131)I excretion, or serum (131)I concentrations. Negligible quantities of (131)I appeared in the serum following oral administration but (131)I was detected in urine during the first 24 to 48 hours, although these quantities accounted for less than 0.38% of the administered dose in any subject.

Here, we assess the ability of the pH-sensitive poly 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine (PMPC)- poly 2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate (PDPA) polymersomes to encapsulate chemotherapeutic agents for effective combinational anticancer therapy. Polymersome uptake and ability to deliver encapsulated drugs into healthy normal oral cells and oral head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells was measured in two and three-dimensional culture systems. PMPC-PDPA polymersomes were more rapidly internalized by HNSCC cells compared to normal oral cells. Polymersome cellular uptake was found to be mediated by class B scavenger receptors. We also observed that these receptors are more highly expressed by cancer cells compared to normal oral cells, enabling polymersome-mediated targeting. Doxorubicin and paclitaxel were encapsulated into pH-sensitive PMPC-PDPA polymersomes with high efficiencies either in isolation or as a dual-load for both singular and combinational delivery. In monolayer culture, only a short exposure to drug-loaded polymersomes was required to elicit a strong cytotoxic effect. When delivered to three-dimensional tumor models, PMPC-PDPA polymersomes were able to penetrate deep into the center of the spheroid resulting in extensive cell damage when loaded with both singular and dual-loaded chemotherapeutics. PMPC-PDPA polymersomes offer a novel system for the effective delivery of chemotherapeutics for the treatment of HNSCC. Moreover, the preferential internalization of PMPC polymersomes by exploiting elevated scavenger receptor expression on cancer cells opens up the opportunity to target polymersomes to tumors.']",,

Endogenous sulfite is maintained at a low, steady-state concentration by a mitochondrial enzyme, sulfite oxidase, that promotes the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate that is excreted in the urine. Sulfites can also be metabolized to thiosulfates (enzymatic reaction of sulfite with 3-mercaptopyruvate) or S-sulfonate compounds (nonenzymatic reaction with disulfide bonds). Thiosulfate and S-sulfonate were detected at very low concentrations in the urine of normal humans or rats, but were excreted in large amounts by those deficient in sulfite oxidase. /Sulfites/', 'Sulfite that enters the body via ingestion, inhalation, or injection is metabolized by sulfite oxidase to sulfate. Oral dose studies using dogs and rats and intravenous (IV) dose studies using rabbits, rats, and rhesus monkeys, demonstrated rapid metabolic clearance. In all species </= 10% of the administered dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. One difference in the metabolism kinetics of exogenous sulfite versus endogenous sulfite is that hepatic oxidation of exogenous sulfite (at least in rats) is diffusion limited. The liver metabolizes a constant fraction of sulfite it receives, but a finite amount will pass through the organ and enter the systemic circulation. /Sulfites/', 'A principal mechanism of detoxification of SO2 (and sulfite/bisulfite) occurs through the enzymatic activity of sulfite oxidase, resulting in the production of sulfate. /Sulfites/']",

Absorbed fluoride is distributed throughout the tissues of the body by the blood. Fluoride concn in soft tissues fall to exposure levels within a few hours of exposure. Fluoride exchanges with hydroxyl radicals of hydroxyapatite (the inorganic constituent of bone) to form fluorohydroxyapatite. Fluoride that is not retained is excreted rapidly in urine. In adults under steady state intake conditions, the urinary concn of fluoride tends to approximate the concn of fluoride in the drinking water. This reflects the decreasing retention of fluoride (primarily in bone) with increasing age. Under certain conditions perspiration may be an important route of fluoride excretion. The concn of fluoride retained in bones and teeth is a function of both the concn of fluoride intake and the duration of exposure. Periods of excessive fluoride exposure will result in increased retention in the bone. However, when the excessive exposure is eliminated, the bone fluoride concn will decrease to a concn that is again reflective of intake. /Fluoride/']",,

Within 8 hours of dosing the major part of an 35S-dose was absorbed. Within 72 hours of the administered dose, 96% in rats and > 97% in mice was excreted in the urine and feces. There were no significant sex differences noted in rats, while in mice females excreted somewhat more in the feces than corresponding males. Apart from this no sex differences in absorption and excretion were noted. Tissue residues (35S-labelled) in both rats and mice were extremely low at 72 hours. Residues in tissues following acute or sub-acute (10-daily) doses were generally low and associated with tissues concerned with distribution and excretion. Of the 6 tissues examined at various intervals after dosing (from 1 to 72 hours) the following sequence reflects tissue distribution: liver > kidney > lung > heart >> blood = brain. This same qualitative relationship of tissue distribution was reflected over the time for maximum tissue clearance.', 'Comparative studies on the metabolic fate of 35(S)-labeled edifenphos in rats and mice are described. Dose levels were 10 mg/kg in female rats and 20 mg/kg in mice and male rats. Only 15 to 30% of the administered radioactivity was detected in digestive organs 6 hr after administration. At 72 hr, only a trace amount of radioactivity was found over the whole body of the animals. The major part of the radioactivity was excreted via urine (75-90%) and feces (5-20%). The main metabolite of the rat is ethyl hydrogen S-phenyl phosphorothiolate (54-57%) and that of mice is dihydrogen S-phenyl phosphorothiolate (3 1-42%). Diphenyl disulfide was found in feces in both animals, but metabolites such as methyl phenyl sulfide and its derivatives were absent. Thus edifenphos is rapidly absorbed, metabolized and eliminated from mice and rats following oral administration.']","['The major metabolite in /the urine of/ rats was the des-S-phenyl hydrolysis product while in mice the mono-S-phenyl phosphorothioate was prevalent (further dealkylation of the major rat metabolite). In feces, small (< 2%) quantities of edifenphos were noted as well as diphenyl disulfide', '...Edifenphos was degraded primarily by loss of the phenyl, thiophenyl and ethyl groups to give organophosphorus acids. The ultimate metabolites were phosphoric and sulfuric acids. Furthermore, oxidation and methylation were apparent in the later stage of metabolism, and conjugated metabolites were formed.', '14C-Edifenphos was degraded in rice primarily by loss of phenyl, thiophenyl, and/or ethyl groups to give organophosphorus acids, the ultimate products being benzenesulfonic acid and presumably phosphoric acid.', 'Metabolism occurs principally by oxidation, hydrolysis by esterases, and by transfer of portions of the molecule to glutathione.  Oxidation of organophosphorus insecticides may result in more or less toxic products.  The glutathione transferase reactions produce products, that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Hydrolytic and transferase reactions affect both thioates and their oxons. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/', 'For more Metabolism/Metabolites (Complete) data for EDIFENPHOS (7 total), please visit the HSDB record page.']",

(See all compounds classified as Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists.)'],"['2-Amino-3-(methylamino)-propanoic acid (BMAA) is a neurotoxic, excitatory amino acid which has been linked through cycad use and consumption with the onset of a variant of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis occurring with high incidence in the western Pacific region. ... To evaluate its kinetics and uptake, BMAA (25-400 mg/kg) was administered to rats, either acutely or chronically, and then plasma and brain concentrations were determined at various times thereafter by combined gas chromatography mass spectrometry. After single dose i.v. injection, BMAA was cleared from plasma in a rapid distribution phase (Vd approximately 16 liters/kg) followed by a slower elimination phase (half life approximately 1 day). Brain uptake was limited by a low blood-brain barrier permeability-surface area product of 2 to 5 x 10(-5) mL/sed/g. Brain BMAA levels peaked within 8 hr after injection, and then declined with a t1/2 similar to that of plasma. After two weeks of continuous infusion (100 mg/kg/day), steady-state brain concentrations equalled 10 to 30 ug/g, and only moderately exceeded those in plasma. The results suggest that BMAA may reach potentially toxic levels in brain (i.e., greater than 250 uM) after large doses (greater than 100 mg/kg). However, such doses are orders of magnitude greater than those available from dietary or medicinal use of cycads.', 'beta-N-Methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is a neurotoxic plant amino acid that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the high incidence amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and related parkinsonism dementia of the western Pacific. Previous studies have demonstrated that BMAA is taken up into brain following intravenous or oral administration. To examine the kinetics and mechanism of brain transfer, BMAA influx across the blood-brain barrier was measured in rats using an in situ brain perfusion technique. BMAA influx was found to be saturable with a maximal transfer rate (Vmax) of 1.6 +/- 0.3 x 10(-3) umol/s/g and a half-saturation constant (Km) of 2.9 +/- 0.7 mM based on total perfusate BMAA concentration. Uptake was sodium independent and inhibitable by excess L-leucine, but not by L-lysine, L-glutamate, or methylaminoisobutyric acid, indicative of transfer by the cerebrovascular large neutral amino acid carrier. L-BMAA competitively reduced brain influx of L-[14C]leucine, as expected for cross-inhibition. The results demonstrate that BMAA is taken up into brain by the large neutral amino acid carrier of the blood-brain barrier and suggest that uptake may be sensitive to the same factors that affect neutral amino acid transport, such as diet, metabolism, disease, and age. /beta-N-Methylamino-L-alanine/']","[""The non-protein amino acid, beta-N-methylaminoalanine (BMAA), is neurotoxic and has been implicated in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-Parkinsonism-dementia (ALS-PD) complex of Guam. This concept remains controversial, in part because of the lack of a convincing animal model. The neuropharmacology of BMAA is well established, but little is known of its metabolism. ... BMAA changed the distribution of taurine, glycine and serine between rat brain slices and their incubation medium; the glutamate/glutamine cycle between neurones and glia was also compromised. In model experiments BMAA reacted non-enzymatically with pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, releasing methylamine. Rat liver and kidney homogenates, but not brain homogenates, also formed methylamine and 2,3-diaminopropanoic acid when incubated with BMAA. These results provide evidence that several biochemical mechanisms are involved in the neurotoxicity of BMAA. The novel discovery that methylamine is formed from BMAA in rat liver and kidney preparations may be significant since chronic administration of methylamine to rats causes oxidative stress. The extent to which this reaction occurs in different animal species might be a decisive factor in selecting an animal model. /beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine/""]","['... 2-Amino-3-(methylamino)-propanoic acid (BMAA) (25-400 mg/kg) was administered to rats, either acutely or chronically, ... .

The quantitative relationships indicate that the thiocarbamates yield chloroacroleins on metabolic activation with the mixed function oxidase system alone, while the intermediate S-oxidation products were detoxified on diversion to chloroallylthiols when the glutathione/glutathione-S-transferase system was also present. The major mouse microsomal mixed function oxidase metabolites of three compounds were identified by HPLC cochromatography as the corresponding sulfoxides. It was concluded that the formation of mutagenic chloroacroleins involves primarily sulfoxidation of diallate followed by sigmatropic rearrangement-1,2-elimination reactions and S-methylene hydroxylation of triallate and sulfallate and then decomposition of their alpha-hydroxy intermediates. Competing glutathione-S-transferase catalyzed conjugations with glutathione divert the sulfoxidized intermediates from activation involving chloroacrolein formation to detoxification on chloroallylthiol liberation.']",

Muscle tissue contained low residues of unchanged bromopropylate while liver and kidneys also contained 4,4'-dibromobenzilic acid during the feeding period."", 'The absorption, distribution and elimination of bromopropylate were evaluated in rats. [U-14C]phenyl bromopropylate was given orally at single doses of 0.5 mg/kg bw (at a no-effect level) or 100 mg/kg bw (to produce some pharmacological/toxicological effect) to groups of 5 male and 5 female rats (Sprague-Dawley Crl: CD [SD] BR). At the low dose level an additional group received 14 consecutive daily doses of 0.5 mg/kg bw non-labelled compound (>95% pure) followed by a single dose with radiolabelled compound. Under all three dosing regimens the total recoveries of radioactivity within 168 hr past termination of dosing were 90% and higher. Most of the dose was eliminated in feces (males: 85.3-89.3%, females: 52.5- 63.7%). Lower amounts of radioactivity were excreted in the urine (males: 2.3-3%, females: 21.8-28.7%).  Excretion of radioactivity was essentially complete within 96 hr independent of dose level or pretreatment. No radioactivity was expired in CO2. At the low-dose after 168 hr, tissue concentrations were low with highest values in liver (0.05 ug equivalents of bromopropylate/g tissue in male or female) and abdominal fat (0.02 or 0.03 ug equivalents of bromopropylate/g tissue in male or female). At the high dose, the tissue residue pattern was similar, with highest concentration of radioactivity in the abdominal fat (equivalent to 3.3 or 8.7 ug/g in male or female). Pre-treatment with the non-radiolabelled compound did not significantly alter tissue residues at 168 hr post-dose over those animals receiving a single administration. It was concluded that excretion rates were fast, and independent of dose level and pretreatment. The routes of elimination were sex-dependent. The low tissue residue levels were observed at 168 hr after administration.']","['When exposed to bromopropylate, spider mites (tetranychus urticae kock) & house flies (Musca domestica l) metabolized this material to bromine analogs of benzilic acid, benzhydrol, benzophenone, & benzoic acid.', 'Bromopropylate was metabolized by rat liver preparations, especially by the microsomal & the nuclear supernatant fractions. The limiting reaction was the cleavage of the ester linkage by carboxylesterases. The main metabolite was p-bromobenzoic acid.', ""Only the parent compound was detected in the adipose tissue and the milk of a cow which had received 0.33 mg/kg/day of 14C-labelled bromopropylate for 5 days. Most of the activity found in the feces was the parent compound as shown by analysis of the first post-treatment day sample which contained 92% parent compound, the remainder being unidentified metabolites. The majority of activity in urine consisted of 4,4'-dibromobenzilic acid and a more polar unidentified metabolite. Other possible metabolites, 4,4'-dibromobenzohydrol, 4,4'-dibromobenzophenone and 4-bromobenzoic acid were not found. In the feces of rats administered bromopropylate 60% of activity was parent compound and 20% 4,4'-dibromobenzilic acid."", 'The structures of 8 metabolites were identified from urine and feces, covering 80% and 72% of the dose for males and females,  respectively. ...It is concluded that bromopropylate was metabolized preferentially by cleavage of the isopropyl ester and to a minor extent by oxidation reactions attacking the phenyl ring and the isopropyl group. The primary product formed after ester cleavage, the benzilic acid, was subject to subsequent conjugation reactions, leading to a variety of amino acid conjugates, or was excreted as such. Metabolites formed after oxidation were 3-hydroxy-benzilate and a propylene glycol derivative of the parent compound.', 'The metabolic profile of bromopropylate was investigated in urine, feces, and tissue extracts from male and female rats. The study involved single oral administration at a low (0.5 mg/kg bw) and high dose level (100 mg/kg bw), and repeated oral administration at the low dose level. ...In the urine pools, representing 1.7-26.4% of the administered dose, there were 7 distinct metabolite fractions. The metabolite pattern did not significantly differ between the dose levels or dose regimen. However, a pronounced sex difference was observed: the benzilic acid was a minor fraction (10-14%) in males but the major fraction (65-72%) in females. The metabolite pattern in feces did not significantly differ between dose levels, dose regimen and, in contrast to urine, between the sexes. The urinary and fecal metabolic patterns differed qualitatively: there was a non-polar fraction in the feces, corresponding to unchanged bromopropylate, which represented 14-54% of the total fecal radioactivity. The metabolite pattern in liver tissue was not sex-dependent and rather simple with the two major fractions corresponding to bromopropylate and the benzilic acid. The pattern in kidney tissue was also not sex-dependent. It contained only one major fraction accounting for at least 80% of the radioactivity in kidneys and corresponding to the benzilic acid. The benzilic acid accounted for at least 70% and 40% of the radioactivity in male and female lung tissue, respectively. The fat tissue contained unchanged bromopropylate as a major component representing 40% and 80% of the radioactivity for males and females, respectively.  Thus, within the tested dose range the metabolism of bromopropylate in the rat was independent of dose level and dose regimen. However, a pronounced sex difference was observed in all groups. The benzilic acid was a minor metabolite in males (approximately 6% of the dose) and the major metabolite in females (approximately 23% of the dose). This parallels the sex difference observed for the route of excretion. The dominant compound in kidney and lung tissue was the benzilic acid, in fat tissue the unchanged bromopropylate, and in liver tissue both were present in substantial amounts.']",

Because of the associated risks, clindamycin should be reserved for serious infections for which the use of less toxic antimicrobial agents are inappropriate.  Clindamycin is active against a number of gram-positive aerobic bacteria, as well as both gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes. Resistance to clindamycin may develop, and is generally the result of base modification within the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete, and may also occur between clindamycin and macrolide antibiotics (e.g. [erythromycin]) due to similarities in their binding sites.  As antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are geographically distinct, local antibiograms should be consulted to ensure adequate coverage of relevant pathogens prior to use.']",,"['Oral bioavailability is nearly complete, at approximately 90%, and peak serum concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) of, on average, 2.50 µg/mL are reached at 0.75 hours (T<sub>max</sub>). The AUC following an orally administered dose of 300mg was found to be approximately 11 µg•hr/mL. Systemic exposure from the administration of vaginal suppository formulations is 40-fold to 50-fold lower than that observed following parenteral administration and the C<sub>max</sub> observed following administration of vaginal cream formulations was 0.1% of that observed following parenteral administration.', 'Approximately 10% of clindamycin bioactivity is excreted in the urine and 3.6% in the feces, with the remainder excreted as inactive metabolites.', 'Clindamycin is widely distributed in the body, including into bone, but does not distribute into cerebrospinal fluid. The volume of distribution has been variably estimated between 43-74 L.', 'The plasma clearance of clindamycin is estimated to be 12.3-17.4 L/h, and is reduced in patients with cirrhosis and altered in those with anemia.']","['Clindamycin undergoes hepatic metabolism mediated primarily by CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP3A5. Two inactive metabolites have been identified - an oxidative metabolite, clindamycin sulfoxide, and an N-demethylated metabolite, N-desmethylclindamycin.']",['The elimination half-life of clindamycin is about 3 hours in adults and 2.5 hours in children. Half-life is increased to approximately 4 hours in the elderly.']

Chlorella is a unicellular green algae sold as a health food or health supplement. Chlorella in the diet of rats also enhanced the fecal excretion of PCDDs from 0.8 to 5.6 and PCDFs from 0.9- to 11.1-fold above that of rats on a control diet. Dietary fiber, chlorophyll, and /or lipid in the Chlorella may be factors responsible for the enhanced fecal excretion of PCDDs and PCDFs observed in this study. Thus, fiber and/or Chlorella may be other dietary factors capable of increasing the fecal excretion of PCDDs and PCDFs. /Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans/', 'In general, absorption is vehicle-dependent and congener-specific. Passage across the intestinal wall is predominantly limited by molecular size and solubility. These parameters are most significant for hepta- and octachlorinated congeners, which exhibit decreased absorption in mammals. The predominant CDD carriers in human plasma are serum lipids and lipoproteins, but chlorine substitution plays a role in the distribution in these fractions. For most mammalian species, the liver and adipose tissue are the major storage sites of CDDs; in some species, skin and adrenals also can act as primary deposition sites. 2,3,7,8-Substituted CDDs are the predominant congeners retained in tissues and body fluids. Tissue deposition is congener-specific and depends on the dose, the route of administration, and age. CDDs are very slowly metabolized by the microsomal monooxygenase system to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glucuronic acid and glutathione. The major routes of excretion of CDDs are the bile and the feces; smaller amounts are excreted via the urine. In mammalian species, lactation is an effective way of eliminating CDDs from the liver and other extrahepatic tissues. /Chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/', 'Most experimental tissue distribution and elimination data are obtained after exposure to a single congener, while real-world exposure to TCDD and related compounds occurs as a complex mixture of congeners. ...The persistence of various PCDDs and PCDFs in hepatic and adipose tissue of male and female marmoset monkeys /was examined/. Animals received a single subcutaneous exposure to a defined PCDD/PCDF mixture (total dose of 27,800 ng/kg bw), which contained 120 ng TCDD/kg bw. Using the now somewhat dated I-TE (internation TCDD toxic equivalence) factors, the total administered dose corresponded to 464 ng I-TE/kg bw. The concentrations of specific congeners in liver and adipose tissue were measured at 1, 6, 16, or 28 weeks after exposure... . All 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDDS and PCDFs were consistently more persistent in the adipose tissue of marmoset monkeys. In general, the persistence in adipose tissue was from about 1.3-2.0 fold greater than that in liver, with the exception of 1,2,3,4,7,8-/1,2,3,4,7,9-hexaCDF, heptaCDFs, and OCDF, which were more than threefold more persistent in adipose tissue. For the latter congeners and OCDD, there was marked variance in half-life values, which may be due to delayed and incomplete absorption of the exceptionally persistent congeners and the relatively short (28 weeks) period of investigation. ...One week after exposure..., the non-2,3,7,8-substituted PCDDs and PCDFs were present in liver and adipose tissue in relatively minor quantities compared with 2,3,7,8-substituted congeners; however, non-2,3,7,8-substituted compounds represented a considerable percent of the exposure mixture. In this study, none of the non-2,3,7,8-substituted TCDDs, penta-CDDs, TCDFs, or penta-CDFs could be detected in the liver by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. Some of the hexa and hepta congeners were detected in adipose tissue and liver, but after 1 wk, the total amount in the liver was more than 5% of the dose administered only in the case of 1,2,4,6,8,9-hexaCDF. Similar results were obtained in rats after exposure to a defined, complex mixture of PCDDs and PCDFs. Additional short-term studies in rats provide evidence that the low tissue concentration of non-2,3,7,8-substituted congeners, measured 1 wk after exposure, was the result of rapid elimination, since these congeners were detected at higher levels in the liver 13 to 14 hr after exposure. These results in monkeys and rats are compatible with data from analysis of human tissue samples and milk in which the non-2,3,7,8-substituted congeners have also not been shown to be present in significant concentrations compared with the 2,3,7,8-substituted congeners. /Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans/', '...A digestive tract mass balance study of six German men (age 41-73 yr) with occupational exposure to PCDDs and PCDFs /was conducted/. Blood lipid levels of the subjects in 1996 ranged from 84-505 pg/g lipid for TCDD and 270-640 pg/g lipid for TEQs, compared with background levels in unexposed persons of 5.2 and 32 pg/g lipid, respectively. The daily quantity of nonmetabolized 2,3,7,8-chlorine substituted PCDDs and PCDFs excreted in the feces exceeded the daily uptake from food, indicating significant clearance across the gastrointestinal tract. The concentration of these compounds in feces was also found to be highly correlated with that in blood, demonstrating that the fecal PCDD and PCDF content was related directly to the body burden of these compounds. No significant clearance (excretion via feces at least fourfold greater than uptake by food) was observed for congeners, including 2,3,7,8-TCDF, 1,2,3,7,8-pentaCDF, 1,2,3,4,7,8,9-heptaCDF, or octaCDF, which were not markedly elevated in the serum lipids. Together, these results support the relationship that fecal excretion is regulated by the lipid-based blood concentration of these compounds. The half-lives in these subjects, due to fecal clearance of nonmetabolized congeners, were estimated from the excretion rate and current body burden and ranged form 10 years for octaCDD (OCDD) to 22 years for TCDD to 33 years for 2,3,4,7,8-penta CDF. Congener-specific half-lives... were also calculated based on the decrease in serum lipid levels of congeners between 1990-1992 and 1996. The fecal clearance of non-metabolized PCDDs and PCDFs contributed on average from 37% (TCDD) to 90% (OCDD) of the total elimination. Thus, fecal clearance plays an important role in the overall elimination of most congeners, with the daily fecal excretion estimated to be equivalent to the amount of TEQ present in about 1.7 g of blood lipids. /Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans/']","['Little is known about the metabolism of these compounds in mammalian systems.

Once converted, Fe2+ serves to support various biological functions. Iron promotes the synthesis of oxygen transport proteins such as myoglobin and hemoglobin, and the formation of heme enzymes and other iron-containing enzymes involved in electron transfer and redox reactions. It also acts as a cofactor in many non-heme enzymes including hydroxylases and ribonucleotide reductase. Iron-containing proteins are responsible in mediating antioxidant actions, energy metabolism, oxygen sensing actions, and DNA replication and repair. Saturation of transferrin from high concentrations of unstable iron preparations may elevate the levels of weakly transferrin-bound Fe3+, which may induce oxidative stress by catalyzing lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species formation.']",,"['Iron absorption and systemic iron homeostasis are regulated by hepcidin, which is a peptide hormone that also regulates the activity of the iron-efflux protein, ferroportin-1. Iron is mostly absorbed in the duodenum and upper jejunum. Fe3+ displays low solubility at the neutral pH of the intestine and is mainly be converted to ferrous iron (Fe2+) by ferric reductases, as ferric salts are only half as well absorbed as ferrous salts. Once converted in the intestinal lumen, Fe+2 is transported across the apical membrane of enterocytes. The absorption rate of non-haem iron is 2-20%. Stored iron may be liberated via ferroportin-mediated efflux, which is coupled by reoxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ by ceruloplasmin in the serum or hephaestin in the enterocyte membrane. Fe3+ subsequently binds to transferrin, which keeps ferric cation in a redox-inert state and delivers it into tissues.  It is proposed that there may be separate cellular uptake pathways for ferrous iron and ferric iron. While ferrous iron is primarily carried by divalent metal transporter-1 (DMAT-1), cellular uptake of ferric iron is predominantly mediated by beta-3 integrin and mobilferrin, which is also referred to as calreticulin in some sources as a homologue. However, the most dominant pathway in humans is unclear.', 'Iron is predominantly conserved in the body with no physiologic mechanism for excretion of excess iron from the body, other than blood loss. The pharmacokinetic properties of ferric compounds vary.', 'Less than 65% of iron is stored in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, mainly as ferritin and haemosiderin. The pharmacokinetic properties of ferric compounds vary.', 'The rate of iron loss is approximately 1 mg/day.
